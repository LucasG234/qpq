The news is an incremental positive for Apple as we Enterprise Value (B)                                 $1,018       have previously estimated tariffs could negatively impact Appleâ€™s EPS 52-Week Range                             $142.00 - $264.88       by 4-8% (under 10% scenario) and 10-20% (under 25% scenario). Fiscal Year End                                         Sep Given the lack of a price reaction and the publicity around the Cook/Trump relationship, we think investors generally expect the iPhone to avoid the final round of tariffs (either tariffs are delayed or Earnings Summary                                                  Apple gets an exemption. Arguments in favor of the exemption 2018       2019      2020E        include: 1) The scale of Appleâ€™s production in China makes it difficult Revenue (B)            Q1        $88        $84        $87        to move quickly, 2) Tariffs would give Samsung an advantage, 3) most Q2        $61        $58        $61        importantly, the Administration wants to avoid consumer backlash Q3        $53        $54        $58        from an increase in iPhone prices. Net/Net: Apple continues to benefit Q4        $63        $64        $69 from the Cook/Trump relationship, but the tariff situation is clearly fluid FY       $266       $260       $275 and will remain an overhang for the foreseeable future. We maintain EPS                    Q1      $3.89      $4.18       $4.47 our OP rating and $275 target.

Our math assumes ~1/3 of total COGS are subject to US tariffs with the remaining COGS balance either representing international or services costs. The low end of our 4- 1 Year Price History                                              20% range assumes 10% tariffs with ~50% of costs passed on to the customer while the high-end assumes 25% tariffs and 100% of costs absorbed by AAPL. What We Are Hearing From Investors: Discussions on AAPL have centered on the path forward for the stock and how much room might remain for it to keep working higher. Individual key points have been levers for iPhone strength and the upside/potential for an eventual 5G device. We think investor focus will also be on driving growth in AAPLâ€™s Services and Wearables business thatâ€™s sustainable regardless of underlying iPhone trends. We continue to think the underweight positions in AAPL remain sizable and that the upside will, Source: FactSet                                                   to some extent, be driven by further multiple expansion, and not just EPS growth. EVR AAPL Thesis: While we understand iPhone units (and sales) will remain muted through FY20 (5G launch), the narrative has and continues to shift towards services and a higher mix of recurring revenue for AAPL. Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables 2-4% share reduction, and d) wearables sales inflect higher and have better margins.

We see Wearables sustaining growth rate in the 20-30% range Q4       $63        $64        $69 and exceed $60B in revenue in FY23. Overall, we see Wearables and FY      $266       $260       $275 Services enabling ~5-6% organic growth for AAPL even if iPhone EPS                    Q1     $3.89      $4.18       $4.47 units stay flat from here.

Wearables will become an important growth vector given both Watch & Airpods are at relatively low install base penetration. **Contact us for our Wearables model in excel** 1 Year Price History Wearables 101: The wearables business includes sales of the Apple Watch, AirPods, Apple TV, HomePod, Beats, iPod Touch, and various accessories. Currently, we estimate Watch is the largest product with ~52% revenue share in FY19 followed by Airpods with ~26% share. Going forward, we think Airpods will be the largest Wearables product in FY23 (~48% of revenue). Sizing Up The Wearables Market: Since the release of the Apple Watch in April 2015, Appleâ€™s wearables business has grown from ~$6B in FY14 to ~$24B in FY19. We think the Wearables business can sustain a growth rate in the 20-30% range and hit exceed $60B in Source: FactSet revenue in FY23 (Consensus at $44B in FY22). Our $64B FY23 Wearables revenue estimate assumes Airpods sustain a 50% CAGR through FY23 and Watch grows at a 20% CAGR (vs. 37% FY15- FY19). At ~$64B in revenue, we estimate Wearables would generate ~$3.00 in earnings vs. FY19 contribution of $1.06. The ~$2.00 in incremental Wearables earnings would represent growth of ~17% vs. Appleâ€™s FY19 EPS of $11.89. Low penetration relative to iPhone install base: We estimate the install base for the Apple Watch and AirPods are at 75M & 50M, respectively. Our estimates imply the install base for Airpods & Apple Watch is less than 10% of the iPhone install base. The low relative install bases should support continued high growth as iPhone owners become buyers of AirPods and Apple Watch.

We also assume the Beats business declines at a 5% CAGR (Airpods cannibalizing) and other products decline at a 2% CAGR. We assume Wearables earns a ~25% pre-tax margin and use FY19 share count (i.e. no buybacks) to arrive at our $3.00 FY23 Wearables EPS estimate.

The high growth has primarily been driven by the success of the Apple Watch and Airpods. Going forward, we think Apple Watch and Airpods will continue to drive high growth, but we do not expect much growth out of HomePod or Apple TV.

Apple with its large installed base of close to 1bn iPhone users and significantly more than 1bn users across its different devices, remains underappreciated in our view relative to its positioning to leverage this shift in advertising dollars. In this report we look at the different services through which Apple can drive higher advertising revenues. Apple has been exploring advertising through Apple Search Ads Apple has more recently discussed seeing good growth in advertising revenues, including posting the highest advertising revenue ever in the latest quarter. The advertising revenue that Apple is generating currently stems from Apple Search Ads on the App Store. Starting in late 2016, Apple started to suggest applications in response to keyword searches in the App Store, which would be shown at the top of the search results. The positioning of an application at the top of the search results (explicitly marked as an ad) in response to searches mimicks the Google Search advertising model and has allowed Apple to ramp up on an advertising business. Figure 1: Apple Search Ads Note: Image displayed is a screenshot from Apple's App Store. Source: Apple. See an opportunity to expand monetization further on the App Store Apple has restricted itself to positioning only one advertisement/suggestion per keyword search from a consumer on the App Store. We believe there is an opportunity to ramp it further and expand to more than one advertisement without necessarily impacting the consumer experience in the future. Although subsequent suggestions would not allow for similar ASP metrics as the first suggestion in response to the keyword search, we still see a step up in the monetization opportunity; particularly given the advertisement is close to point of sale itself. 3 59 Samik Chatterjee, CFA                                        North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                                             15 November 2019 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Internet paid search is $100 bn+ revenue opportunity market To provide some context about the revenue opportunity, internet paid searches account for a ~$100 bn market and are growing in relevance as it is expected to grow ~8% per annum from 2018 to 2020. With consumption of content moving increasingly towards mobile platforms, we expect the strong growth in advertisement spend on mobile platforms will continue. Interestingly, Alphabet highlighted on its recent earnings call the shift of traffic to mobile platforms as well as higher acquisition cost of traffic on mobile platforms relative to traditional desktops (â€œThe sites TAC rate increased year-over-year primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TACâ€, Alphabet 3Q19 earnings call).

Apple accounts for > 15% of global internet paid search market already Apple does not direct advertisements relative to paid search outside of the App Store, instead getting monetized by Google for directing traffic to their search engine. The strong market position that iPhones have globally, particularly in the US, drives Google to be willing to pay a hefty sum to be the default search engine for the traffic from iOS devices. Googleâ€™s total traffic acquisition cost of $30 bn annually includes roughly $14 bn of annualized traffic acquisition costs from distribution partners, which include Apple. Assuming typical gross margin of ~55% and that Apple accounts for 65% of the TAC paid by Google to distribution partners, implies that Apple supports $17 bn of advertising revenue for Google â€“ which equates to around 17% of global advertising revenue dedicated to paid searches.

Notably, the manufacturing and component commitments FY     $11.87     $11.89      $13.10 reflect AAPLâ€™s desire and need to co-invest with its strategic supply- chain partners in order to ensure availability of capacity. We also note that AAPL has vendor non-trade receivables of $22.8B up from 1 Year Price History                                              $12.3B last qtr. These are receivables from EMS partners resulting from AAPL selling components to EMS companies who manufacture and assemble the final product. Warranty & FX: AAPL recorded warranty accruals of $1.5B (+16% y/y). We estimate the q/q change in accrued warranty negatively impacted gross margin by ~20bps. Accruals for product warranty were 1.7% of total revenues, slightly above the past 3 yearsâ€™ average. In Jun-qtr AAPL saw $180M of f/x hedging headwinds -$104M in revenue, -$44M in cost of sales and -$32M in Other income. We think these hedges had a less than 10bps gross margin impact (vs. 38.0% reported gross margin). Source: FactSet Regional Performance: AAPL saw operating margin y/y declines across all regions other than the EU where margins were up 30bps. Margins were down only slightly in the Americas (-20bps), while Japan (-110bps), China (-230bps), & other Asia-Pac (-100bps) all fell more than 100bps. Lawsuits: In April 2019, Apple & Qualcomm reached an agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide. Apple didnâ€™t disclose the QCOM payment amount. Apple is still involved in ongoing litigation with Virtnex over allegations Apple has infringed upon Virtnex patents. Capex: In a change from prior filings, Apple did not provide full-year capex guidance. Please see the analyst certification and important disclosures on page 6 of this report.

Our PT increased from $289 prior reflecting slightly higher revenue and stronger cash generation in FY20. What we learned from Apple's September (F4Q19) quarter earnings report: (+/-) iPhone 11 cycle strong out of the gate. Our view has been that iPhone replacement rates are nearing a ceiling, roughly in-line with notebook PC replacement rates, setting up for improving and more stable growth in the medium-term (Exhibit 1). The combination of battery and camera innovation alongside more affordable pricing and trade-in/financing offers are proving catalysts for stronger upgrade rates during the iPhone 11 cycle. In the September quarter, iPhone revenue beat our forecast - $33.2B vs. MSe $32.7B - and December guidance implies continued improvement in the iPhone revenue growth trajectory (F1Q20 iPhone revenue -3% vs. -9% in F4Q19). Importantly,         Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a Apple did not build iPhone channel inventory in the September quarter (nor          result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a plans to in December) ahead of potential tariffs suggesting the recent positive     conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider supply chain data points represent real demand upside. Americas growth was          Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making particularly strong - +7% Y/Y vs. +2% Y/Y in F3Q - as the region benefits from a    their investment decision.

(+/-) Services growth acceleration should continue. Apple Care and App Store drove the Services acceleration helped by higher Apple Care attach rates and wide partner distribution as well as a broad based acceleration in App Store growth as indicated by Sensor Tower data ahead of the earnings report. New services, led by Apple TV+, and to a lesser extent Apple Arcade and Apple Card should allow services growth to accelerate further in FY20 and FY21. We model Services revenue of $12.8B (+18% Y/Y) in the December quarter and $55.5B (+20% Y/Y) in FY20, well ahead of Apple's previously stated goal of $48.7B, and in-line to ahead of consensus estimates of $12.8B (Dec Q) and $53.5B (FY20). Notably, we forecast contracting Services gross margins going forward (63.4% in FY20; 62.6% in FY21), due in part to the inclusion of Apple TV+ in our Services model, yet sequential growth in high margin Services like App Store and iCloud could act as a more meaningful offset than we currently model. (+/-) Wearables continue to lead growth. Many investors attributed 50% wearables growth in the June quarter to shorter lead times as demand caught up with supply, however a second quarter in a row of 50%+ Y/Y growth and the fact that Apple is beating AirPods forecasts weekly suggests strong double-digit growth is sustainable. Said another way, we believe Apple Watch and AirPods penetration among the iPhone installed base remains far below mature levels, and considering 3 of every 4 Apple Watch customers are new to the device, expect a long growth runway going forward. We forecast broad-based strength of the Wearables portfolio in FY20, with Apple Watch revenue growth of 24% Y/Y (due in part to the Series 5 launch), AirPods growth of 107% Y/Y (fueled by AirPods Pro at a higher ASP), Apple TV+ growth of 12% Y/Y (aided by the launch of Apple TV+) and all other Wearables, Home and Accessories growth of 5% Y/Y, resulting in total Wearables, Home and Accessories growth of 43% Y/Y in FY20 vs. 41% Y/Y in FY19.

The company issued guidance for revenue in the range of $85.5-$89.5bn (or                EPS ($)     11.91 11.89    13.25       15.25 $87.5bn at the midpoint) versus the Streetâ€™s $85.9bn expectation.

In our 10/28 note, â€œFoot and Web Traffic Rundownâ€¦ iPhone 11 Launch Exceeding Expectations,â€ we highlighted that foot traffic at stores and web traffic to retailer sites indicates a very strong start for iPhone 11. While we see the results and guidance as positive, we think thereâ€™s still conservatism built into forward guidance. Traffic to retailer iPhone pages grew 66% sequentially in the September quarter versus our estimate of 19% sequential growth in iPhone shipments implied in results. We get the sense that demand is still tracking well ahead of supply. We continue to see potential upside for results relative to guidance and Street expectations based on iPhone 11 outperformance in FYâ€™20 and the 5G cycle in FYâ€™21. In our view, the 5G cycle is still the biggest catalyst for Apple moving forward with our FYâ€™21 iPhone unit estimate now at 209m versus the consensus for 194m.

Solid September Quarter Resultsâ€¦ Apple reported September quarter revenue of $64.0bn (+19% Q/Q, +2% Y/Y) versus our $63.2bn expectation (Street = $62.8bn). iPhone revenue totaled $33.4bn (+28% Q/Q, -9% Y/Y) versus the $32.5bn consensus. All businesses outperformed Street expectations except Mac which met a tough comparable from multiple MacBook Pro launches in the year ago quarter. For the total company, this was the highest September quarter revenue in company history. On the bottom line, reported GAAP EPS hit $3.03 versus the $2.83 consensus. Record Quarter for Wearables & Services... Management noted strong performance by Wearables and Services which both hit record revenue levels. Wearables set a Q4 record with revenue of $6.5bn (+18% Q/Q, +54% Y/Y) versus the $6.0bn consensus. Apple watch, AirPods and Beats products drove the performance for Wearables. Services revenue totaled $12.5bn (+9% Q/Q, +18% Y/Y) versus the $12.3bn consensus with record revenue in every geography.

We think the consensus 190m figure is too low as: 1) thereâ€™s a larger and aging installed base of iPhone coming up for refresh â€“ even if upgrade cycles are 3+ years; 2) 5G will be big â€“ the marketing machines at every wireless operator will be driving a 5G message with consumers; 3) the 5G iPhone cycle will offer more significant product differentiation versus prior cycles; 4) worldwide smartphone rates are higher versus prior cycles; and 5) Appleâ€™s expanding mid-range offerings. Of course, the offset is a softer Chinese economy vis-Ã -vis prior iPhone cycles. | Catalysts â€¢ Any positive developments on the US/China trade war â€¢ Product introductions â€¢ Acceleration of the share repurchase program October 31, 2019                                                                                                                                       2 Please see important disclosure information on pages 7 - 12 of this report. 143"

Lastly, Apple did not report the impact of non-designated derivatives in    e = Morgan Stanley Research estimates F4Q and therefore we removed it from our analysis. Vendor non-trade receivables plus inventory continues to decline. Vendor non- trade receivables (an indication of inventory sitting at contract mfgs) plus inventory declined 9% Y/Y in the September quarter, reflecting the third Y/Y decline in the last 12 months after increasing Y/Y through most of 2017 and 2018 (Exhibit 2). However, we expect a return to growth in the December quarter as we approach easier comparables, especially if iPhone growth continues to improve. Large memory pre-buys have largely been worked through, in our view, which should allow lower NAND prices to benefit gross margin. On a sequential basis vendor non-trade receivables plus inventory increased 72%, slightly above the prior three year average of 68% (Exhibit 3), coinciding with bullish company commentary on iPhone 11 demand. By segment, the 4% increase in inventory Y/Y         Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with was more than offset by the 11% decrease in trade receivables Y/Y. Additionally,     companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a vendor non-trade receivables increased above the seasonal trend (86% vs 74%          conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of average) while inventory increased slightly more than the seasonal trend (22% vs     Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making average 17%).                                                                        their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, No longer providing capex guidance. Apple did not provide FY20 capex guidance        refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this in the 10-K, which is a change from prior filings. The company is not planning to    report. 1541 disclose a forecast given the metric can be volatile based on the company's hybrid internal/external model for funding assets such as tooling and data centers making the metric less correlated to volumes and therefore less relevant to investors. In FY19, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment was the biggest contributor to the $7.6B capex spend, followed by data centers and corporate facilities and infrastructure. Separately, Apple's 10-K indicated that App Store, licensing, and AppleCare, were the three largest Services growth drivers in FY19. This is largely consistent with the prior year, however licensing was ranked as the leading growth driver in FY18 (followed by App Store and AppleCare). 1552"

Additionally, Services revenue growth reaccelerated as expected in F4Q19 from trough levels of growth registered in F3Q19, and the upside to our model was likely driven by higher monetization of the installed base, which has positive implications for sustainability of strong Services revenue growth despite a likely moderation in the pace of installed base growth.

Source: Company Data, Evercore ISI Research 2 218 October 30, 2019 iPhone Product Line Overview: The first version of the iPhone was released in January 2007, and sales began in June 2007. Appleâ€™s current generation iPhones retail for $749-$1099. On its FQ1:19 earnings call, Apple disclosed that the iPhone install base now exceeds 900m active users. iPhone Refresh Cycle: Since the launch of the original iPhone, Apple has updated the product annually and has redesigned the iPhone every two years. The elongation of the iPhone refresh cycle has become central to the bearish narrative as recent redesigns have offered minimal incremental functionality. We think refresh demand will likely remain muted until Apple unveils a 5G compatible model (expected in 2020).

The 9% y/y decline was an improvement from the 12% decline in the Jun-qtr.

Key drivers of the longer replacement cycle include: 1) introduction of EIP programs and 2) increasing iPhone prices, and 3) limited improvements in functionality between different generations. EIP & Replacement Cycle: T-Mobile was the 1st carrier to offer iPhone EIPs (equipment installment plan) in 2013. EIPs represented a significant share of the market by 2015 with all carriers offering EIP options. The plans decoupled cost of the phone & wireless services by Source: FactSet separating lease and mobile service payments. Initially, EIPs were expected to result in faster upgrades, but they had the opposite effect as the plans made consumers more aware of how much an iPhone costs. We estimate replacement cycle increased from ~28 in FY13 to ~36 months by end of FY15 as EIPs grew to dominate the market. Used Phones Driving Install Base Growth: Our replacement cycle model estimates the total iPhone install base is around 650M, which is 250M less than reported by Apple. We think the delta is explained by used phone buyers who are new to the iPhone & iPhones which are not registered with a mobile carrier (people using older phone like iPod touch). The base of used buyers has doubled from ~125M in 2015 as both carriers and Apple have pushed more favorable trade-in plans and new iPhones have become more expensive. We see a robust used market as a positive as it brings new users into the ecosystem. Please see the analyst certification and important disclosures on page 9 of this report.

We think the consensus 190m figure is too low as: 1) thereâ€™s a larger and aging installed base of iPhone coming up for refresh â€“ even if upgrade cycles are 3+ years; 2) 5G will be big â€“ the marketing machines at every wireless operator will be driving a 5G message with consumers; 3) the 5G iPhone cycle will offer more significant product differentiation versus prior cycles; 4) worldwide smartphone rates are higher versus prior cycles; and 5) Appleâ€™s expanding mid-range offerings. Of course, the offset is a softer Chinese economy vis-Ã -vis prior iPhone cycles. | Catalysts â€¢ Any positive developments on the US/China trade war â€¢ Product introductions â€¢ Acceleration of the share repurchase program October 28, 2019                                                                                                                                   2 Please see important disclosure information on pages 24 - 29 of this report. 262 EQUITY RESEARCH Apple Inc. (AAPL) Foot and Web Traffic Rundown â€“ iPhone 11 Launch Exceeding Expectationsâ€¦ Our analysis of store foot traffic data in the US and website traffic globally indicates that customer interest for iPhone 11 is tracking better than the XS last year. Model level analysis of website data also shows that high-end flagship models are performing well with no substantial evidence of customer downshifting. We think this sets up iPhone performance to come in ahead of conservative Street expectations for the September quarter. This is important for investors given that the September Street consensus iPhone estimate assumes a 10% Y/Y decline (42.4m units). Our estimate is 42.5m â€“ in line with consensus. While weâ€™re not changing our numbers, we think there is a meaningful positive bias heading into September quarter results and December guidance on Appleâ€™s earnings call Wednesday. In our 9/24 report â€œUnderappreciated Position for 5G + Services Expansion = Buy Rating,â€ we outlined our view that the Street was too conservative on iPhone units in FYâ€™20 and meaningfully underestimating Appleâ€™s position for the 5G cycle in FYâ€™21. Our positivity on FYâ€™20 was more driven by mid-range devices with the bulk of our differentiation versus Street numbers coming in the back half of FYâ€™20. Now we think there can be upside from a â€œbetter than fearedâ€ iPhone 11 cycle beginning now. Our biggest differentiation versus Street consensus remains our view on iPhone units in FYâ€™21 driven by 5G. The positive performance of iPhone 11 (the last all-4G cycle) now builds a nice bridge to 5G and we think investors should get involved now. We reiterate our Buy rating on the shares and raising our Price Target to $285/share (or 17.9x our base business FYâ€™20 EPS estimate) based on potential for upside to iPhone units in FYâ€™20. Store Traffic Shows iPhone 11 Launch Having Early Successâ€¦ Our analysis of customer foot traffic across Apple and wireless carrier stores in the US shows that the iPhone 11 launch is having early success. In aggregate, we see that stores saw a 37% increase in traffic on iPhone 11 launch day versus a 32% increase for the iPhone XS launch last year. We see customer interest on launch day as a strong early indicator for how demand will track for the remainder of the annual product cycle. Our Methodologyâ€¦ SafeGraph is a data service that dynamically tracks visitor counts across retail locations and other points of interest. We used SafeGraph underlying data to assess the popularity of the iPhone 11 portfolio post launch and how it compares to previous launches of iPhone 8/X and XS in 2017 and 2018, respectively. We selected a sample of 228 retail locations on a geographically distributed basis in the US. We limited our panel to locations with clean SafeGraph data on iPhone launch date for each of the three years (2017, 2018, and 2019). As shown in Chart 3 below, we included Apple stores and each of the 4 main wireless carriers as these retailers drive the majority of US unit sales.

Source: SafeGraph, Jefferies Research To assess the success or popularity of the launch, we calculated the â€œexcess percentageâ€ of daily visitors on the release date versus the expected normal traffic for the same weekday of the same month. Expected normal traffic includes service requests/Genius Bar for the Apple store and bill inquiries for the Wireless carriers. Using excess percentage, weâ€™re able to assess the volume of customers coming to the location motivated by Appleâ€™s iPhone launch versus anything else. For a location to be included in our panel, it must have at least 5 SafeGraph visitors on the release date and the â€œexcess percentageâ€ on that day versus the 3-month moving average must be larger than 10%. Further, the location must meet this criteria in all three years in order to make the analysis a â€œsame storeâ€ comparison across years. Launch Day Store Traffic Shows Customer Interest for iPhone 11 is Higher Than the XS Cycleâ€¦ Our analysis of store traffic for the September 20th iPhone 11 launch shows improvement over 2018 for the Apple Store and all four major wireless carriers. In aggregate, retail locations in our panel experienced a 36.6% increase in visitors versus normal level (excess percentage). Thatâ€™s up versus a 31.9% increase versus normal levels in 2018. See Chart 4 below for a summary of excess traffic percentage by retailer brand and launch year.

Source: SafeGraph, Jefferies Research The excess traffic percentage for the iPhone 11 launch hasnâ€™t reached 2017 levels, not surprisingly. December 2017 was a 77m iPhone unit period for Apple while the Street is expecting 65m for December 2019. We think the more salient data point is the improvement versus last year given the Streetâ€™s expectation for a Y/Y unit decline for the September quarter (F4Qâ€™19). Consensus currently calls for 42m units for Sepâ€™19 (-10% Y/Y) and 65m units for Decâ€™19 (-1% Y/Y). In our view, the bias is positive heading into the September results and December quarter guidance. Customer Demand at iPhone 11 Launch is Broad Based â€“ No Regional Level Biasâ€¦ To assess the regional performance of the iPhone 11 launch, we looked at the geographical distribution of our panel locations and their associated excess percentage versus normal traffic levels. As shown in Charts 5, 6, and 7 below, the regional performance of the iPhone 11 launch was broad-based with no significant regional bias.

Fun Facts: 1) AAPL typically guides Dec-qtr gross margins up 50bps vs. Sept-qtr guide, this would imply 38-39% GM guide (vs. street at 37.5%), 2) Apple TV promotions will make headline sept-qtr print subdued ($60/device goes to deferred), 3) f/x is a notable drag here 4)services should accelerate in H2 vs. street modelling a deceleration. Buyside Expectations: Investors expect modestly higher revenues for sept-qtr vs. street at $63.0B (guide is at $61-64B). From a segment perspective, iPhone revenues expected to decline low-teens to $32.8B, services expected to be up q/q (~low 12B range, >$12.5B would be notable upside). Most think gross-margins are towards Source: FactSet                                                   around 38.0% range (something >38.5% would be upside). While units will not be disclosed our discussions suggest buyside is looking for ~44M iphones in Sept and â€œhigh 60Mâ€ units for Dec-qtr. In terms of Dec-qtr guide, investors are expecting revenues to be guided inline to modestly ahead of street. Ranges for Dct-qtr are: revenues in $85- 88B range (street at $86B), GMâ€™s expected to be guided 37.5-38.0% (this is debated, if they guide this up would be positive) and EPS anticipated around $4.40-4.60. Key Focus Points: 1) Apple TV impact, 2) services and its trajectory going forward, 3) China centric demand commentary on hardware and services, 4) F/x dynamics on sales and eps, 5) gross-margin dynamics going forward, 6) tariff impact and offsets heading into H2 and 7) channel inventory and implications for next product launch.

Our September quarter revenue estimate moves 1% higher to $63.0B (from $62.5B), towards the upper end of Apple's $61-64B guidance range, which with an unchanged gross margin forecast of 38% (at the midpoint of management guidance) results in $2.85 of EPS (Exhibit 2). For the December quarter, we now model $86.9B in revenue (+3% Y/Y), a 38.1% gross margin, and $9.7B of OpEx (which is slightly higher than seasonal given the expected close of the Intel modem business acquisition), which drives our $4.50 EPS forecast (down from $4.52). We believe the buy-side is expecting December quarter revenue guidance          Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with of $84-87B, a mid-point 2% below consensus, and a gross margin around 38%,              companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making Jan 2, 2019 pre-announcement) and margins in-line with last year's disappointing        their investment decision.

There are a number of factors in play that give us confidence that iPhone replacement cycles may be in the process of stabilizing. First, we believe demand in China continues to improve, with smartphone data from the Chinese government pointing to international vendor (of which we believe Apple is 90%+) shipment growth of over 25% Y/Y in the September quarter (Exhibit 4), and China smartphone installed base data showing that Apple gained Y/Y installed base share for a 9th consecutive month in September (Exhibit 5). Second, the earlier launch of all 3 new iPhone models (creating an easier compare) and relative outperformance of new model shipments this year vs. last per our iPhone shipping tracker (Exhibit 6 and Exhibit 7) tells us that new models will be a more significant contributor to C2H19 estimates than in C2H18. Third, iPhone builds are increasing, rather than decreasing, through mid-October, as demand expectations appear to be outperforming early forecasts from the supply chain. And while the risk of iPhone build cuts remain as is the case seasonally near year-end, our new September and December quarter unit forecasts of 44.5M (from 43M) and 66.75M (from 64M), respectively, remain ~7% below our Greater China Tech Hardware team's iPhone build forecasts, reflecting some conservatism. Net, our new FY20 iPhone shipment forecast of 190M (from 182M) assumes that replacement cycles stabilize around 3.7 years, which still represents a near structural ceiling relative to 4 year notebook replacement cycles (Exhibit 8). ...but lower ASPs act as an offset, resulting in largely unchanged iPhone revenue estimates. While we increase our near-term iPhone unit estimates, we also decrease our ASP estimates to $733 (from $752), $757 (from $789), and $706 (from $736) in F4Q19, F1Q20 and FY20, respectively, to account for the $50-100 cut to iPhone 11 prices (relative to the iPhone XR launch last year) and relative outperformance of the iPhone 11 in markets like China, where the Jiguang data shows the iPhone 11 representing 0.26% of the iPhone installed base in China vs. 0.14% and 0.06% for the iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone 11 Pro, respectively (Exhibit 9). Similarly, data from the iPhone grey market in China shows pricing for the 64GB and 256GB iPhone 11 SKUs has held up moreso than for the iPhone 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max, which helps confirm the relative outperformance of Apple's lower priced new model iPhone (Exhibit 10). Net, while our iPhone unit estimates move higher each quarter through FY20, our ASP estimates fall by 2-4%, resulting in iPhone revenue of $32.7B, $50.3B and $134.4B in F4Q19, F1Q20 and FY20, respectively, which is largely unchanged from our prior estimates. We'd note that the ASP deferral from the bundling of the free offer for Apple TV+ (as discuss in our recently published Insight note) was already embedded in our iPhone ASP estimates, so these changes are only reflective of our new mix expectations. We expect Wearables and App Store to continue outperforming. While these two segments collectively represented just 20% of Apple's revenue mix in FY17, we estimate they will account for over 100% of Apple's revenue growth in FY19 and represent over 30% of revenue in FY20. Earlier this week, Luxshare (covered by Yunchen Tsai), a key AirPods manufacturer, beat expectations on the back of stronger than expected AirPods volume, which we believe is a sustainable trend following the launch of the second-gen AirPods in March, and a rumored third- gen noise-cancelling AirPods potentially before year end. On the Services side, 3152 data from Sensor Tower shows App Store net revenue grew ~22% Y/Y in the September quarter, representing 4 points of outperformance vs. our +18% Y/Y estimate, and a 3.5 point growth acceleration from 18.4% Y/Y growth the June quarter (Exhibit 11), the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth acceleration since the December 2015 quarter. Our updated September quarter Services estimate of $12.4B (+17.2% Y/Y) now accounts for this outperformance (slightly offset by more significant a la carte music and video declines), which is likely not accounted for in consensus estimates that forecast a continued deceleration in Services revenue growth (Exhibit 12). Looking forward, App Store comps continue to ease into the December quarter (most notably in China), and we expect contributions from new Services such as Apple TV+ to begin impacting the model as early as the December 2019 quarter as well, resulting in our forecast for 17.7% Y/Y growth next quarter (Exhibit 13). 3163"

Below we highlight the three      companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a most important debates from our Apple TV+ analysis.                                 conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Key Debate 1: How much upside can Apple TV+ drive to Services estimates?            Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making Apple TV+ is set to launch next week, helping accelerate Services revenue           their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, growth, not previously accounted for in our model. With an attractive price point   refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this at $4.99/month, and wide initial distribution to the Apple installed base via the   report. 3341 bundled free year offer (Exhibit 3), we estimate Apple TV+ can become a $9B revenue business with 136M paid subscribers by FY25, assuming just 1 in every 10 Apple user pays for the Service by FY25, in line with our Apple Music penetration forecast (Exhibit 4). Net, TV+ adds 2 points to our Services revenue growth forecast in FY20 (to $55.1B in revenue, from $54.2B prior; Exhibit 6). Beyond FY20, we see Apple TV+ contributing slightly more than 1 point on average to Services growth annually through FY23 (to $89.8B in revenue, from $85.7B prior; Exhibit 7). Assuming a straight-line amortization schedule, we estimate Apple TV+ content costs (expensed as COGS) ramp from $401M in FY20, to $4.5B in FY25 (Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9), which dilutes Services gross margins by 11bps in FY20, and up to 125bps in FY23 (to 61.7%, from 63.0% previously; Exhibit 10), but the higher Services revenue base more than offsets Services margin dilution such that Services gross profit dollars increase by 2.5%, on average, between FY20 and FY23. All of our detailed Apple TV+ drivers and assumptions can be found here: Diving Into Our Apple TV+ Assumptions. Key Debate 2: How material is the near-term headwind from bundling a one year free Apple TV+ offer with device purchases and ramping video content costs? We worked closely with Morgan Stanleyâ€™s Global Valuation, Accounting and Tax (GVAT) team to embed ASC 606 revenue recognition and streaming content accounting standards into our Apple TV+ model. At the heart of this debate are two issues. First, the accounting treatment of bundling a one year free offer to Apple TV+ with the purchase of any iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod Touch or Apple TV, where Apple will likely have to defer ~$57 per iPhone sold to be amortized as Apple TV+ Services revenue over the year the free trial is active, but only for customers who Apple expects to redeem the free Apple TV+. We assume the Apple TV+ free offer adoption is in-line to lower relative to iCloud adoption in its first year, starting at 5-10% conversion in F1Q20 and reaching as high as 40%, for some customers by F4Q20 (Exhibit 12). These assumptions imply Apple will likely defer $900M net ($1.6B gross) of hardware ASP in F4Q19-F4Q20, resulting in a 20bps headwind to FY20 total revenue (Exhibit 13). More details on the mechanics of how this flows through the P&L can be found in Exhibit 14. The second aspect of this debate relates to how much Apple is spending on content at the launch of Apple TV+, and how those costs are accounted for. Media companies can account for video content costs in several ways (see: Media, Internet & GVAT: Streaming Changes Everything - Even The Accounting Rules); we assume that Apple capitalizes all content costs on the balance sheet and then amortizes the costs as Services COGS in a straight line method over a 3 year period. Our bottom-up analysis of costs implies the programs set to launch November 1st correspond to $585M of production costs with only $35M accounted for as COGS in the December 2019 quarter. We assume Apple rolls out 2 shows per month after November corresponding to a total of over $2B of total production costs by FY20 year-end and $401M of amortized costs included in Services COGS in FY20 (Exhibit 15), resulting in a 1.9% headwind to FY20 EPS, which is now accounted for in our model. For Apple TV+ to have a more material impact to our near term estimates, we'd have to assume 1) Apple TV+ production costs are significantly higher at the launch of the Service, and/or 2) more users redeem the Apple 12 month free offer with the purchase of a device. In the latter case, FCF is unchanged and Apple would exit FY20 with a higher base of users to convert to paid subscribers, 3352 putting upward pressure on our outer year estimates. See Exhibit 16 for a sensitivity analysis of how changes to our Apple TV+ accounting assumptions impact Apple's near-term revenue and EPS. Key Debate 3: Is Apple TV+ accretive or dilutive to overall estimates? Apple has publicly commented ""We do not expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results."" Our analysis is largely consistent with that conclusion. We estimate that in FY20, the incremental revenue from Apple TV+ will not be enough to offset the hardware deferral, which when combined with over $600M in incremental COGS and OpEx from Apple TV+ (we assume Apple TV+ OpEx as a % of revenue is twice the Apple corporate level) results in a 1.9% headwind to FY20 EPS (Exhibit 17). However, we expect Apple TV+ to become accretive by 0.8% in FY21 as previously deferred hardware revenue is amortized as Apple TV+ revenue and free Apple TV+ users convert to paid subscribers, accelerating user growth, which more than offsets the ramp in content costs and operating expenses associated with Apple TV+. Beyond FY21, we expect Apple TV+ to become more accretive to revenue and gross profit dollar growth, but ramping TV+ costs imply +0.6% accretion in FY22, and +0.3% accretion in FY23. Raising PT to $289 (from $247) to reflect TV+ ramp and peaking iPhone replacement cycle. Our new $289 price target is derived from a sum-of-the-parts analysis now based on FY21 estimates rather than FY20, as we believe FY21 estimates better capture the sustainable earnings power as new Services, like TV+, ramp and iPhone returns to growth as replacement cycles peak and 5G drives device upgrades. To arrive at our price target we assume a 2.9x EV/Sales multiple on FY21 Product revenue of $233.3B, which represents a blend of an HPQ and MSFT multiple, and a 7.1x EV/Sales multiple on $65.8B of Services revenue, representing the median multiple of a group of 8 platform/services/internet companies, resulting in a 3.8x blended target EV/Sales multiple. Our $289 price target implies Apple trades at 18.7x our new FY21 EPS of $15.46 (up from $15.34 previously), and 23.2x FY20 EPS of $12.44 (down from $12.68 previously), meaningfully higher than Apple's trailing 2-year P/E of 16.3x in light of Services representing over â…“ of total gross profit mix (set to climb to 44% by FY23) vs. just 20% 2 years ago. Notably, our base case FY21 iPhone revenue growth reflects stabilizing, but not shrinking, replacement cycles during the 5G iPhone cycle which increasingly appears conservative given constructive demand data points early in the iPhone 11 cycle. 3363 Key Exhibits Exhibit 1: Our analysis suggests Apple TV+ is worth ~$3 per share in our base case, or ~1% of our $289 price target.

Given a large install base of iPhone 6/6s (we estimate Enterprise Value (B)                                   $894       200M+) and the deployment of iOS 13 (iPhone 6 not compatible) we 52-Week Range                             $142.00 - $233.47       see potential for a low-end iPhone as a catalyst to drive a healthy Fiscal Year End                                         Sep replacement cycle for the iPhone 6/6s install base. In addition, we think the lower priced iPhone could help spur demand in emerging countries as well. The expectation is that the new SE will be similar to Earnings Summary                                                  the 8, with a 4.7â€™ LCD screen and an A13 chip. We expect this phone 2018      2019E      2020E        to replace the current iPhone 8 (the 8 sells for $449, while the Revenue (B)            Q1        $88       $84A        $87        previous SE sold for $349). The low expected price point should help Q2        $61       $58A        $61        incentivize some users with very outdated models to upgrade as the Q3        $53       $54A        $57        A13 chip would offer a significant step up in performance vs. an Q4        $63        $64        $69 iPhone 6/8 (note, iPhone 6 users cannot upgrade to iOS 13). Net/Net: FY       $266       $260       $274 Apple continues to make changes to the traditional â€œ2-iPhones/yearâ€ EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.47 model, which may drive upside vs. consensus expectations for the Q2      $2.73     $2.46A       $2.74 Q3      $2.34     $2.18A       $2.46       remainder of FY19 & into FY20. Maintain OP and $247 target. Q4      $2.91      $2.87       $3.35 Positive iPhone Data Points: There have been numerous data FY     $11.87     $11.69      $13.02 points indicating robust demand for the iPhone 11 and the new iPhone SE should drive further growth into FY20. Positive data points include: 1) Nikkei story reporting Apple plans to increase production volume for 1 Year Price History                                              the iPhone 11 by up to 10%, and 2) EVR iPhone Survey shows strong US Consumer buying intentions. The Sept/Dec-qtr should also benefit from Appleâ€™s decision to launch three phones at its September event (vs. the typical two phone launch). Adding a fourth phone in less than a year should further support sales. Apple Launches its Studio: Hollywood reporter story on Apple launching its in-house studio with a new Spielberg produced show (Masters of the Air). The show is rumored to cost $250M, so it will be one of the more expensive shows available on the service. The studio will be run by Appleâ€™s worldwide video heads (two former Sony Studio executives) and will allow Apple to own the content produced for its Source: FactSet                                                   TV+ service. The move to produce content in an in-house studio is unsurprising as streaming companies have become increasingly focused on owning their content to avoid paying large licensing fees. EVR ISI AAPL Thesis: While we understand iPhone units (and sales) will remain muted through FY20 (5G launch), the narrative has and continues to shift towards services and a higher mix of recurring revenue for AAPL. Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables 2-4% share reduction, and d) non iPhone hardware sales inflect higher and have better margins.

The story 52-Week Range                             $142.00 - $233.47       from Nikkei is consistent with our consumer survey published last Fiscal Year End                                         Sep week which suggested strong demand for the iPhone 11.

Q4      $2.91      $2.87       $3.35 Key Findings from Our Survey: We surveyed ~5,000 individuals FY     $11.87     $11.69      $13.02 regarding their iPhone purchasing intentions. Key points include: 1) Surprisingly, despite concerns about a weak cycle, 40% of respondents are interested in buying a new iPhone, we think this is in 1 Year Price History                                              line to slightly better vs. historical trends. 2) Demand skewing towards iPhone 11 ($699 model) with almost 30% of prospective buyers preferring the 11 vs historically around 10% prefer the lowest price model. 3) We estimate iPhone ASPs will hit ~$800 vs last year at ~$770, implying modest uptick in pricing, though we suspect this reflects more consumers buying directly from AAPL. 4) Average memory per device is expected to remain stable at 168GB/device consistent with our expectations for what happened with the last gen launch, though lower NAND pricing should provide robust GM tailwind, and 5) Strong adoption of AirPods and services like iCloud and Apple Care that should broaden the Apple moat. Source: FactSet                                                   EVR Estimates vs. Street: For the Sept-qtr, our revenue/EPS estimates are at $63.6B/$2.87 vs. Street at $62.8/$2.84. Our FY20 estimates are at $273.7B/$13.02 vs. Street at $270B/$12.84. Note, consensus is calling for a 12% decline in iPhone revenue in the Sept- qtr vs. our estimate of a 10% decline. EVR ISI AAPL Thesis: While we understand iPhone units (and sales) will remain muted through FY20 (5G launch), the narrative has and continues to shift towards services and a higher mix of recurring revenue for AAPL. Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables 2-4% share reduction, and d) non iPhone hardware sales inflect higher and have better margins.

Outside of China, growth in the US was ~26% Y/Y (vs. +28% in August), while growth in Japan slowed to +6% (vs. +17% in August). Worth noting, growth in Japan has historically been pretty lumpy with multiple months of low single-digit growth at the beginning of 2018 followed by multiple months of double digit growth. Growth by Category: Revenue growth from gaming (+19%) and entertainment (+15%) applications came in slightly below the overall growth rate (+22%), while social networking (+23%), music (+38%), lifestyle (+30%), and other (+38%) grew at a higher rate than the overall App Store. Source: FactSet China Lapping Gaming Approval Headwinds: Developer revenue from China grew 29% in September, well above the 10% rate from the first half of the year. Gaming revenue was a key growth driver as the prior year was negatively impacted by China pausing all regulatory approval for new games. This trend will likely continue next quarter and into FY20. EVR View on Services: Investors have been focused more on iPhone trends and less focused on AAPL's ability to grow/ monetize the install base. We estimate AAPL is positioned to sustain >20% Services growth is driven by a combination of increased monetization of install base, growth in user count, and new offerings. Fundamentally, AAPL's Services business is a critical part of the investment thesis, particularly as the smartphone market matures.

We think this reflects robust upgrade momentum vs. tempered investor expectations, driven by attractive ASPs. Nearly 30% of consumers prefer the cheaper iPhone 11, while 23% chose the Pro Max and 19% went for the Pro. Our survey results indicate ASPs will hit ~$806 in Dec-qtr vs. last yearâ€™s ASP of ~$770 with demand for the new generation iPhones coming in stronger than expected. Strong demand for new gen phones coupled with increased mix of consumers buying the phone directly from AAPL should help offset the lower price of the iPhone 11 (~$50/unit cheaper than last yearâ€™s iPhone XR). Average Storage Content Flat: 75% of prospective iPhone 11 Pro/ 11Pro Max buyers opted for higher storage tier (256GB/512GB), this Source: FactSet is more robust vs. historically 2/3rd of buyers opt for middle/high-end tier. Though worth noting the impact to ASPs from here is muted given a larger % are choosing the lower-end iPhone 11 models. Overall, we estimate average storage content remained flat, which is unsurprising as Apple did not make any changes to storage configurations. EVR Estimates vs. Street: For the Sept-qtr, our revenue/EPS estimates are at $63.6B/$2.87 vs. Street at $62.8/$2.84. Our FY20 estimates are at $273.7B/$13.02 vs. Street at $270B/$12.84.

We highlight several key findings from our survey results: 1.   42% of prospective iPhone buyers were looking to purchase a new generation premium model (11 Pro/Max) and ~27% plan to purchase the lower priced iPhone 11. On aggregate, 68% of prospective iPhone buyers preferred the new generation of iPhones (iPhone 11/Pro/Max), which is better than our prior estimate of ~55%. 2.   Our survey results indicate ASPs will hit ~$806 in the Dec-qtr vs. last yearâ€™s ASP of ~$770 with demand for the new generation iPhones coming in stronger than expected. Strong demand for new gen phones should help offset the lower price of the iPhone 11 (~$50/unit cheaper than last yearâ€™s iPhone XR). 3.   75% of prospective iPhone 11/Pro/Max buyers opted for a higher storage tier (256GB/512GB) models vs. our 65% estimate for the XS cycle. 64% of prospective 11 buyers preferred higher storage tier (128GB/256GB), likely due to price sensitivity of these users. 4.   Replacement cycle â€“ although there are concerns about replacement cycles becoming elongated, our survey suggests there could be stability in this metric. 5.   Strong attach rates for Apple Care and AirPods. Mix Shift toward New Gen iPhones Should Benefit ASPs: Our survey results indicate strong demand for iPhone 11 Pro Max, despite its premium price point, with 23% of respondents interested in buying an iPhone preferring it. On aggregate, 68% of prospective iPhone buyers preferred the new generation of iPhones (iPhone 11/Pro/Max), which is better than our estimate of ~60%.

Prospective iPhone 11 buyers selected the higher storage options ~64% of the time while 44% XR/8 buyers opted for higher storage. In addition to higher storage, declining NAND prices should help GM in this cycle. 2 423"

(AAPL) Portfolio Manager Summary Initiating Research Coverage with a Buy Rating and $260 Price Target. Apple, of course, is the franchise player in the consumer electronics business. More holistically, it designs, manufactures and markets mobile communications/media devices and PCs. Alongside its iconic hardware platforms such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, the organization sells a variety of related Software, Services, Accessories, Digital Content, and applications. Looking forward, we believe that a confluence of factors will drive further performance out of the business (and the share price). Specifically, we believe that Street views of the iPhone business are too conservative â€“ particularly for the pending 5G cycle beginning in late next year. Further, we believe their Services business is underappreciated by investors. That business offers a massive expansion in the potential TAM addressed by Apple. Weâ€™re initiating research coverage of the shares with a $260 Price Target and a Buy rating. Key elements of our thesis includeâ€¦ Appleâ€™s â€œFranchiseâ€ iPhone Position Is Secure. Our analysis of ListenFirst digital and social engagement metrics coming out of the iPhone 11/11 Pro launch shows brand engagement is higher than ever for Apple. ListenFirst's Digital Audience Rating was higher for the iPhone 11 than the XS/XR launch last year and Samsung's Galaxy S10 launch in February. iPhone search interest is also showing solid growth over last year. We don't see loyalty waning for Apple as the iOS platform creates incredible stickiness among customers. Also, most of industry profitability comes from the high-end of the smartphone market where Apple holds a dominant position. We donâ€™t expect competitors will make a significant dent in Appleâ€™s iPhone franchise over at least the near- or intermediate-term. Street iPhone Estimates Are Too Conservative. Given the advanced technology and components, 5G devices will be high-end devices (where Apple holds dominant share). Our analysis (built on pricing data by model) of competition and market share across price levels shows Apple's share increases as prices go higher. We think the Street underestimates the benefit Apple gets from this heading into the 5G cycle. Street expectations call for 190m units for the FYâ€™21 5G iPhone cycle, or 9% below the 6- year average unit volumes for prior iPhone cycles. For example, Apple sold 212m, 217m, and 218m, in FYâ€™16, FYâ€™17, and FYâ€™18 (i.e. the iPhone 6S/6S+, 7/7+, and 8/8+/X cycles, respectively). We think the 190m figure is too low given: 1) thereâ€™s a larger and aging installed base of iPhone coming up for refresh â€“ even if upgrade cycles are 3+ years; 2) 5G will be big â€“ the marketing machines at every wireless operator will be driving a 5G message with consumers; 3) the 5G iPhone cycle will offer more significant product differentiation versus prior cycles; 4) worldwide smartphone rates are higher versus prior cycles; and 5) Appleâ€™s mid-range offering will expand their TAM modestly and entice buyers to refresh more quickly. The negative offset is a softer Chinese economy vis-Ã -vis these prior iPhone cycles. As we gauge these factors, we think that a consensus unit shipment figure of 190m is too low. Instead, weâ€™re modelling for 208m units shipped in FYâ€™21. A Significantly Expanding Services TAM. We think the Services opportunity is underestimated broadly by investors. The TAM associated with Apple's Services business is expanding rapidly. In particular, we believe that its recent entries into streaming music (Apple Music), and streaming video (Apple TV+) will generate incremental growth on top of the core business. In our view, Services expansion is also part of Apple's logic for mid- range iPhone offerings. An increasing mix of Service revenue is driven by the size of the installed base versus annual device sales. Additional unit volume from mid-range offerings September 24, 2019                                                                                                 3 Please see important disclosure information on pages 59 - 64 of this report. 436 EQUITY RESEARCH Apple Inc. (AAPL) can certainly benefit from this perspective. We estimate the annual Service revenue Apple generates from every active device will be $38 in FYâ€™20. That's up from $25 in 2017 and growing at 14%. Our iPhone units are ahead of the Street by 9m for FYâ€™20 and most of these are coming from the mid-range. If we assume these are mostly new iPhone users, Apple would make $342m in annual Services revenue off of these customers â€“ or almost a point of services growth. We model each Services business separately with its own fundamental drivers (unique for Street models). The additional detail gives us a more accurate view into subscription revenue and how Services is decoupling from hardware sales. We estimate that subscription revenue is now 6% of company sales and growing. Further, we expect the total Services business to represent 20% of company sales and 38% of operating profit in FY'21, up from 13% and 23% in FY'17, respectively. US/China Trade War = a 10% Effective Tariff Impact Already in Street Models. Based on our tariff sensitivity analysis, weâ€™re assuming that -- after offsets -- Appleâ€™s effective tariff impact would be 10% which translates to a 220bp impact to gross margin and a negative 8% impact to FYâ€™20 EPS. This is already in Street models. Also, relief on memory pricing offers some offset to these tariff impacts. We see lingering economic challenges in China as a more significant potential issue for the company. Of course, that business is already running at depressed levels for Apple. No, Mid-Range Phones Wonâ€™t Cannibalize the High-End. Thereâ€™s a debate in the industry right now about whether Appleâ€™s introduction of lower-priced models will negatively affect total sales and cause customers to downshift out of high-end models. We donâ€™t see customer downshifting becoming a problem for Apple for two reasons: 1) they already sell a whole host of previous generation devices at lower prices so these price points arenâ€™t really new; and 2) our analysis of smartphone spending versus income suggests that consumers tend to buy the most advanced smartphone they can afford. We donâ€™t think consumers will opt for lower-priced models, assuming thereâ€™s still a perceived feature/quality difference between the two price points. Our Views on Other Key Debates: 1. Thereâ€™s Still a Growth Path Left for iPhoneâ€¦ Premium Phone Penetration Isnâ€™t Over. We think thereâ€™s still a growth path left for iPhone and the premium smartphone category overall, even in the face of maturing mobile markets worldwide. For the last 12 years, the smartphone industry was riding waves of growth in global adoption. This was great for Apple and great for most players in the industry because it opened up new categories of customers every year. Given the global success and demand for the smartphone as a computing platform, most global markets charged rapidly toward full adoption. Of course, global smartphone adoption is flattening out. While global smartphone penetration is now 75%+, premium smartphones still represent a much smaller part of the market for smartphones broadly (~16%). Further, premium penetration has increased from 13% in 2012 to 16% in 2018. Looking forward, we think that premium smartphone penetration can continue to tick up over time as economies expand, infrastructure gets built, and more and more people embrace mobile devices with advanced capabilities. 2. Global Economic Development Helps Apple. There are some very large populations in emerging economies. China and India each have 1.4 billion and September 24, 2019                                                                                                    4 Please see important disclosure information on pages 59 - 64 of this report. 437 EQUITY RESEARCH Apple Inc. (AAPL) 1.3 billion people, respectively, versus the 330 million in the US. A considerable number of annual handset units in emerging economies like China and India are still at feature phones or entry-level basic smartphones priced at an ASP of $400 and below (>85%). We think there is solid evidence to support that as these economies continue to expand, theyâ€™ll spend incrementally more on smartphones. We find that spending on mobile devices has a direct relationship to GDP â€“ so effectively those who have more spend more on their mobile device. In our view, weâ€™ve only scratched the surface of premium phone adoption across China and India, much of which is driven (and gated) by the fact that these markets still have relatively low GDP per capita. With GDP per capita growing 6% and 7% for China and India, respectively, we think thereâ€™s additional growth left for the premium smartphone segment. 3. Itâ€™s Hard to see a 5G Phone Delivered at Price Points Below $700. Based on commentary from the supply chain and public BOM estimates for Samsungâ€™s first 5G phone, we think itâ€™s hard to see any vendor able to deliver a fully-featured 5G phone at a price below $700. RF- and modem-related vendors say theyâ€™re expecting dollar content increases in the coming 5G cycle. For example, Skyworks Solutions is saying that it is expecting content per unit increases of 38% with the transition from 4G to 5G as their dollar content per device goes from $18 to $25. Advanced components will certainly push price points above $1,000 for the highest flagship models. Starting at the BOM level, weâ€™ve seen widely-reported BOM estimates for Samsungâ€™s S10 5G phone between $485-$490. When adding another ~$150 for manufacturing, shipping, warranty, and royalties, we estimate that Samsungâ€™s cost of goods sold for the S10 5G would be around $635-640. Unless they price it for extremely low margin (which is rare for high-end devices), Samsung will certainly need to price at around $1,000+ for quite some time. 4. Samsung and Huawei May Struggle When They Move More of Their Portfolio into the $700+ Price Band. We think Samsung and Huawei may struggle as we enter the 5G cycle and theyâ€™re pushed to price more devices at above $700. Apple has significant mindshare of consumers already comfortable with buying at these price points. While Samsung and Huawei have been gaining share at $400+, a significant portion of these units are sold between $400 and $700. Apple has leading (and stable) share of smartphones above $400 which also improves as prices go higher. Appleâ€™s ~60% market share for $400+ increases to ~80% for smartphones priced above $700 and ~90% above $1,000. 5. Additional Mid-Range Offerings Will Boost Appleâ€™s Volume in a Category It Moved Away From. Given Appleâ€™s new enhanced portfolio for the mid-range, we think it is in a position to regain market share in the category. We donâ€™t think the Street fully appreciates Appleâ€™s actions to drive demand by enhancing its mid-range phones as positives. In our view, Appleâ€™s introduction of the iPhone 11 (at $699), price reductions for iPhone XR (now $599) and iPhone 8 (now $449), and pending launch of a 4.7â€ iPhone 8 Refresh (4G+LCD) in the spring will boost Appleâ€™s volume in mid-range devices. The $400-700 price range which we now consider the mid- range is a category that Apple has moved farther away from as it raised prices on the flagship core of its portfolio in 2017. September 24, 2019                                                                                                 5 Please see important disclosure information on pages 59 - 64 of this report. 438 EQUITY RESEARCH Apple Inc. (AAPL) 6. Profitability of Mid-Range Phones is Close to the Blended iPhone Average Anyway. Based on our bottom-up iPhone gross margin model by SKU, we estimate that gross profit dollars per unit for the latest refreshed mid-range devices are near the overall blended iPhone average for the company. As long as the ratio of high-end flagship phones to legacy models remains the same, Apple wonâ€™t see any gross margin pressure by selling more mid-range phones. When Apple raised prices on flagship models in September 2017, it essentially gave it the room to sell older legacy models at reduced prices (and lower gross profitability) for longer. Currently, we estimate that Apple makes around $470 in gross profit dollars per unit for flagship models, $153/unit for legacy models, and $253/unit for mid-range models. The total blended iPhone gross profit dollars per unit is also close to the mid-range number at $262. 7. Consumers Will Still Buy the Highest Spec Smartphone They Can Afford. We believe thereâ€™s still strong evidence that smartphone customers will pay for value and will typically gravitate toward the highest spec smartphone assuming they can afford it. We donâ€™t think it will be very common for an affluent customer to move to a lower spec phone because itâ€™s cheaper. We think this also holds true across different classes of society, the specs are just lower. Years of smartphone industry data support this view, in our opinion, across developed and emerging markets. We find that annual smartphone spending per capita has a tight linear relationship with GDP per capita. Further, we can also note that growth in smartphone spending follows a similar growth curve to GDP per capita in both developed and emerging markets. Based on this dynamic, we think Appleâ€™s mid-range offerings are more targeted at providing an Apple product for more segments of the market and capturing additional volume as middle-class consumers expand worldwide. Further, we donâ€™t think thereâ€™s as much risk as the Street perceives that high-end flagship Apple customers will â€œdownshiftâ€ into lower models. 8. New Promotions, Trade-in, and Financing Programs Should FYâ€™20. We think the 1-year TV+ subscription included with all hardware purchases this season was one of the more important announcements from this yearâ€™s launch. It helps to quickly boost TV+ subscribers but also incentivizes customers to upgrade devices in what they know is the last year before 5G phones arrive. We think the promotion will help support volumes through FYâ€™20. While the promotion appears to be approximately $60 ($4.99 x 12 months) of value transferred to the customer with every device purchase, we donâ€™t think itâ€™s a foregone conclusion that itâ€™s an incremental level of discounting. We understand that Apple can effectively provide targeted discounts through its trade-in programs, which have been in place for years. Looking forward, one element of the trade-in program that will be particularly incremental is China. The new China program was only fully implemented last November. We also like that Apple now accepts most of the major competitors' devices in its trade-in program (including Huawei, Oppo, Samsung, Vivo, and more). We wouldnâ€™t be surprised if Apple quotes trade-ins for competitor devices more aggressively. Apple also recently rolled out new financing programs in the US, China and four other countries which should make it easier for customers to finance their phones in-store or online. September 24, 2019                                                                                                 6 Please see important disclosure information on pages 59 - 64 of this report. 439 EQUITY RESEARCH Apple Inc. (AAPL) 9. Services Growth Isnâ€™t as Linked to Hardware Trends as You Think, Itâ€™s an ARPU Story. ARPU, not Hardware growth, is the primary driver of Services. One of the more common misconceptions about Apple is that device upgrades are the sole driver of Services revenue. While this is certainly important, we note Revenue per Device (ARPU) has been rising every year and is the primary driver of overall Services growth. Underscoring this point, we believe Services will grow at a 21% CAGR through FYâ€™21, a period of time when we model iPhone units declining at a flat CAGR. We believe revenue per device will nearly double from $25 to $44 by 2021. Apple has around 420m paying subscribers today vs 1.4bn active devices, implying only 30% of customers are paying for any of Appleâ€™s Services. 10. TV+ â€“ Apple Has a Unique and Underestimated Position in the TV Ecosystem. We think Apple has a solid position in OTT Streaming Video Services, even among a crowded field of players. As a diversified technology company, Apple is in a unique position as it enters into original content. We think Appleâ€™s installed base of 1.4 Billion devices worldwide gives it a significant reach and advantage over many competitors. Out of the major OTT streaming services (AT&T, Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Google, Disney, Netflix), Apple is one of very few players that have a major footprint in most layers of the ecosystem (content, streaming service, device hardware, and operating system). As it launches TV+, it has original content, an OTT streaming service, an entrenched OS/platform to stream content, and design and sell many of the devices subscribers use to watch (iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Apple TV). This gives Apple a unique advantage for its OTT streaming service launching November 1. 11. The 2019 Launch Year Was Strategic â€“ Third-Party Content Finally Gets Unlocked. In our view, Apple has been planning a TV streaming service for quite a while and focused on 2019 as the most opportune time to enter the market. This is the year when many existing content right deals expired. Content owners were freed from the â€œdirect-to-consumerâ€ distribution restrictions in their previous contracts with traditional Pay-TV providers. That gave Apple the opportunity to garner mindshare with third-party content owners as it created its â€œApple Channelsâ€ offering. We expect that Apple has been talking to all the major content owners to make sure any new contracts were void of â€œdirect-to-consumerâ€ restrictions that would prevent them from monetizing within the Apple ecosystem. 12. Monetizing Their Own Content isnâ€™t Appleâ€™s Only Way to Make Money. We believe that Appleâ€™s strategy for Apple TV+ and its original content is to use it as an anchor for OTT video streaming on its platform. At first, Apple TV+ will serve as an added benefit, but it will not be the only way that Apple will generate streaming video revenue. Appleâ€™s priority will be to use its original content to attract viewers to its platform, giving viewers a better reason to subscribe to other services or buy/ rent content through iOS instead of a third-party platform. Hence, we think Apple chose to price its subscription at $4.99/month (a discount to Disney+ at $6.99/ month), leaving users with more money to subscribe to Apple Channels. The remaining non-Apple original part of the platform will work a lot like App Store and News+ where Apple has a wholesale/retail relationship with third-party content owners selling subscriptions through the platform. Having more people on its streaming platform will improve Appleâ€™s already unparalleled ecosystem, which September 24, 2019                                                                                                   7 Please see important disclosure information on pages 59 - 64 of this report. 440 EQUITY RESEARCH Apple Inc. (AAPL) will make users more dependable on Apple products and services, essentially increasing the switching cost to leave the Apple ecosystem while driving more device sales. Above Consensus Estimates. Looking at FYâ€™20 (Sept) and FYâ€™21, our revenue projections for the business are 2% and 4% above Street expectations, respectively. Specifically, weâ€™re looking for sales of $275.3bn and $297.6bn versus consensus views for $269.3bn and $285.7bn, respectively. Our model drives better-than-expected top-line results from higher- than-Street views for iPhone sales. For example, weâ€™re projecting FYâ€™20 / FYâ€™21 iPhone unit sales of 194m / 208m versus Street numbers of 185m / 190m, respectively. Also, we expect that the Services business will drive incrementally higher sales vis-Ã -vis Street views. On the bottom line, weâ€™re projecting FYâ€™20/FYâ€™21 GAAP EPS of $12.90 and $14.90 versus Street views that call for $12.68 and $14.29, respectively. Of course, the company focused investors in GAAP â€“ rather than non-GAAP â€“ results. Attractive Valuation. Apple shares currently trade at 13.4x our CYâ€™20 base business EPS projection. We think itâ€™s too cheap for a business that should drive 8%+ top line growth and 12%+ EPS power sustainable over time. Also, we expect that growth rates should accelerate above these levels in FYâ€™21 with the development of the 5G / iPhone product cycle. Keep in mind that EPS power could also accelerate with any resolution to the current US/China trade situation â€“ our model currently bakes in a 10% net tariff impact going forward. Our Price Target is $260/share, or 16.2x our CYâ€™20 EPS projection for the base business, more in-line with the Large-cap Tech peer group. We initiate coverage with a Buy rating.

(AAPL) Itâ€™s All About the Premium Market, Appleâ€™s â€œFranchiseâ€ Position is Secure. Apple has a leading and stable position in the premium segment of the smartphone market. Further, given the concentration of industry profitability at the higher-end of the market, we think a commanding position in the premium market is really required for a device vendor to have a lasting presence. Obviously, a number of smartphone companies have fallen from grace over the years (Nokia, Motorola, Blackberry, and HTC), typically because they stop innovating after a few hit products and fail to maintain mindshare at the higher-end. We think Apple stands out from the pack of low-differentiation smartphone vendors trading market share at the lower-end. We see its â€œfranchiseâ€ position in the premium segment of the smartphone market as durable and secure. Of course, the stickiness of its iOS platform is a big part of the recipe for Apple. We outline our thoughts on its market position below: Apple Will Maintain its Dominant Position in the Premium Category. Apple is the leading innovator in the industry, and we think the product portfolio and differentiated level of vertical integration (chip, device, OS, Apps & Services) gives it a multi-year lead over other smartphone vendors in the premium market. Its high and stable share of premium Smartphones even priced as low as $400 is a solid proof point for its competitive advantage. In Chart 3 and Chart 4 below, we illustrate Appleâ€™s share of Smartphones priced at $400 and above. While Appleâ€™s market share has decreased slightly over the last year, itâ€™s remained remarkably stable.

Industry profitability is squarely concentrated in the premium part of the market. This makes sense given the most affluent and least price-conscious consumers make up this market. The premium space is also where customers embrace (and are willing to pay for) advanced components and features. Apple has a noticeable advantage from this perspective given its high and stable market share in the premium category. We think this is a byproduct of its vertical integration (chip, device, OS, App, and Service), relentless focus on customer experience/ design, and advanced R&D capabilities. There is also an element of switching cost and customer lock-in to this business as customers take the time to learn the operating system and have all their apps, purchases, and settings on the device.

Appleâ€™s digital and social engagement compared across multiple launch years shows engagement is higher than ever. ListenFirst provides insight into consumer engagement with brands by aggregating digital and social engagement across multiple channels (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube, and Wikipedia). The ListenFirst Digital Audience Rating measures all public engagement including fan growth, content response, conversation volume, video views, and organic search volume. As shown in Chart 8 below, the peak following the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro launch hit 41.3 million engagements versus 7.7 million for the XS/XS Max/XR launch. Of course, some of the engagement growth comes from the adoption curve of digital and social media, but the metrics are encouraging nonetheless. We think this indicator is more useful for directionality than for magnitude. We don't expect that the 5x brand engagement over last year can turn into 5x the sales, of course. There's a lot baked into these metrics including the volume of content Apple puts out through their channels and how aggressively they promote it.

After clarity from Fiscal Year End                                         Sep       AAPL management coupled with our analysis, we see minimal financial impact and in aggregate think the impact to EPS will be immaterial. We would take advantage of any pullback to add to Earnings Summary                                                  positions in AAPL stock. When a product is sold and the promotion is used it will essentially shift slightly less than $60 from the purchase 2018      2019E      2020E price to deferred revenue. Assuming Apple runs the program through Revenue (B)            Q1        $88       $84A        $87 Q2        $61       $58A        $61 the end of FY20, we estimate they will give away ~250M TV+ Q3        $53       $54A        $57        subscriptions. The financial impact will ultimately be determined by Q4        $63        $64        $69        how much TV+ COGS is recognized alongside the deferred revenue FY       $266       $260       $274        and how long AAPL runs the promotion. Netflix had a gross margin of EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.47       ~37%; however, the margin booked on TV+ will likely be far higher Q2      $2.73     $2.46A       $2.74       due to Appleâ€™s decision to give the service away to product customers. Q3      $2.34     $2.18A       $2.46       Assuming the promotion runs through FY20, we estimate Apple will be Q4      $2.91      $2.87       $3.35       booking revenue from 250M subscribers despite only having 9 shows FY     $11.87     $11.69      $13.02 available at launch vs NFLX with ~165M subscribers and ~200 shows. This results in a drastically higher margin at TV+ as we estimate Apple will be booking ~$7.5B in FY20 TV+ revenue on ~$170M in amortized 1 Year Price History                                              costs. We estimate the FY20 impact of the TV+ promotion will be less than ~4% (some revenue being pushed into FY21). Net/Net: Our analysis of the impact of TV+ is consistent with Appleâ€™s statement that it will not have a material impact on financial results. If the program is run through FY20, we see potential for a ~4% decline in EPS; however, these earnings would merely be pushed to FY21 and there is no cash impact. Maintain OP and $247 target. Breaking Down Content Amortization: COGS for a streaming service is primarily composed of amortized content costs. Applying Netflixâ€™s accelerated content amortization schedule to the reported $6B TV+ budget, we get a year one amortization expense of ~$2B. Source: FactSet                                                   This would imply a ~7% negative impact to FY20 EPS; however, the actual amortized content cost will likely be far lower. Production costs begin to be amortized when the content is first made available on the library and the $6B budget likely reflects spend over multiple years. TV+ will have only nine shows at launch, and even if we assume that the first seasons of See & the Morning Show cost as much as the final season of Game of Thrones ($150M), total costs to be amortized at launch will likely be less than $500M. This would result in a ~3% impact to FY20, as some revenue is pushed into FY21. Management Comments: â€œThe combination of a year of Apple TV+ with the purchase of a new device is accounted for as a bundle. For customers that we expect to redeem the offer of a free year of TV+ service, we will defer revenue from the applicable device sale based on the value of the service relative to the bundle and recognize the deferred amount over the year the service is provided. The deferred amount      will    be     amortized     as    services    revenue.â€ Please see the analyst certification and important disclosures on page 4 of this report.

Management teams and panel participants expressed greater optimism on the pace of technological change in healthcare compared to prior years. Over the last three years, national health expenditures as a percent of GDP has stabilized, suggesting progress is being made under the surface. Meanwhile, 2nd and 3rd generation entrepreneurs who failed in their first healthcare ventures are now returning to the space. Greater entrepreneurial efforts combined with growing healthcare investment from large tech platforms is providing renewed promise for the direction of the US healthcare system. Full stack technology solutions from companies such as Livongo are demonstrating meaningful success and step- function improvements in patient satisfaction, while natural language processing startups such as Notable are driving down administrative cost burdens. However, the rise of tech-focused healthcare offerings doesn't mean complete disruption.        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Investors should consider Apple is no exception as it has partnered with leading payors, providers, and          Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making research institutions.                                                                 their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, Livongo (Diabetes Management): Livongo's full stack diabetes management                refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this solution and AI feedback mechanism is worth paying attention to as it could            report. 5141 prove to be a compelling road map for other tech-led healthcare services. The full stack solution analyzes a constant flow of patient data and offers recommendations or 'nudges,' which use AI to maximize efficacy. Greater efficacy leads to increased customer satisfaction, lower costs, and improved outcomes. We believe this model is similar to what Apple is attempting with activity tracking and heart health. Apple is already leveraging AI to nudge users with custom recommendations to 'close their ringsâ€™, which entails hitting calorie, activity, and stand goals. Meanwhile, Apple is launching a Heart & Movement Study that aims to discover the interplay between activity levels and heart health. If Apple can successfully leverage participant's activity and data to determine the optimal amount of activity to maximize heart health, it can then deploy AI-based 'n udges' to influence user activity and help curb heart related health issues. DexCom (Continuous Glucose Monitoring Devices): DexCom discussed a potential value-based economic model that we believe Apple could use to monetize its own healthcare offerings. DexCom has worked with UnitedHealthcare to study the potential reduction in overall cost of care for Type-2 diabetes patients through continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). While DexCom suggested UnitedHealthcare will likely keep study results internal, management mentioned that early indications of CGM adoption driving improved patient outcomes and cost of care reductions are promising. Further, management indicated they are exploring a model whereby DexCom could realize a 10-15% take rate on a payorâ€™s per-patient cost savings driven by CGM utilization. This value-based model is similar to what we theorized as a monetization method for Apple's healthcare efforts. If Apple can demonstrate a tangible reduction in patient costs through the use of its health offerings (Watch, Health app, Health Records, etc.), Apple could charge payors a take rate on those cost savings. Though DexCom and UnitedHealthcare remain in early stages of exploring these capabilities, the learnings could ultimately be applied to UnitedHealthcare's own partnership with Apple, potentially accelerating the timeline of Apple health monetization. It's worth noting that Medtronic already has value based contracts in place in pumping, so there is already precedent for this model in diabetes. iRhythm (Ambulatory EKGs). iRhythm's Verily partnership demonstrates the value of the asymptomatic AFib market - a market Apple is indirectly addressing with its Apple Watch EKG functionality. Verily provides iRhythm two things: data and hardware. Data will drive better patient identification which will drive better cost-economics for payors. Verily can help deliver a new form factor (ex: watch) with extended monitoring periods. Management believes the market for finding the right patients and screening them could be larger than the market of managing a select few. Identifying a patient with AFib prior to symptoms / issues will save money and lives, which could incentivize payors to subsidize or fully reimburse devices that detect AFib. Management also alluded to the importance of more targeted patient identification when searching for asymptomatic patients (silent AFib) in the broad population. We think Apple's scale gives it a competitive advantage here. The longer a company searches for patients with AFib, the more data is collected, which helps refine the AFib detection algorithm. In turn, this helps identify more AFib instances, leading to more cost savings and more lives saved. While details on iRhythm and Verily's hardware are scare, it 5152"

Fundamentally, AAPL FY       $266       $260       $274        remains a core large cap tech holding and we see the stock EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.47       continuing to re-rate higher given multiple tailwinds on the services Q2      $2.73     $2.46A       $2.74       side.

The increase is primarily driven by a higher iPhone unit sales estimate, partially offset by a lower ASP estimate (launching lower cost phone, incentive 1 Year Price History                                              programs). We are now forecasting iPhone revenue to fall ~10% in Sept-qtr vs consensus ~12% decline. Services Accelerate in August: App store revenue growth continues to accelerate as we lap last yearâ€™s Chinese gaming approval headwinds coupled with tailwinds across multiple categories. Assuming the App Store can maintain its August growth momentum through the remainder of the fiscal year, we see potential for upside to FQ4:19 consensus estimates (modeling services growth of 23% in Sept-qtr). We estimate total App Store developer revenue grew to ~$3.5bn in August, up 26% Y/Y (vs. +19% in July). China revenue growth continues to accelerate with China developer revenue growing 32% Y/Y in the month of August (vs. +20% in July). Source: FactSet EVR ISI AAPL Thesis: While we understand iPhone units (and sales) will remain muted through FY20 (5G launch), the narrative has and continues to shift towards services and a higher mix of recurring revenue for AAPL. Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables 2-4% share reduction, and d) non iPhone hardware sales inflect higher and have better margins.

Arcade is a seemingly straightforward way to monetize the install base by more directly entering a lucrative market (gaming ~75% of App Earnings Summary                                                  Store revenue), while the TV strategy appears more nuanced. Apple 2018      2019E      2020E        is spending heavily on a limited number of originals (think HBO) while Revenue (B)            Q1        $88       $84A        $87        aggressively undercutting competitors on pricing and offering the Q2        $61       $58A        $61        service as a product incentive. Its possible Apple sees TV+ as more of Q3        $53       $54A        $57        a way to incentivize iPhone sales in a year when consensus is calling Q4        $63        $63        $68 for declining iPhone revenue. The iPhones reveal focused on new FY       $266       $259       $272 photo/video features (multiple lenses, night mode), longer-battery life EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.45 (11 Pro +4 hours of life vs. XS), and the new A13 Chip (better GPU for Q2      $2.73     $2.46A       $2.72 Q3      $2.34     $2.18A       $2.45       gaming, deep learning accelerators). Given recent efforts to shorten Q4      $2.91      $2.83       $3.31       the replacement cycle (trade-ins, financing, free TV+), we think the FY     $11.87     $11.66      $12.93       announced improvements should be sufficient to drive flat to slightly up iPhone revenue. Net/net: The new services offerings demonstrate Appleâ€™s continued effort to monetize its 1.4B global install base and 1 Year Price History                                              we think the combined offerings could eventually bring in > $20B in annual revenue. No surprises on the hardware side, but we think consensus may be underestimating the steps Apple has taken to increase product sales. Maintain OP and $238 target. Sizing the TV+ & Opportunity: The financial opportunity for TV+ is difficult to estimate with a lot of uncertainty around conversion from free to paid subs and the potential high churn of service with a limited number of shows. Apple has not disclosed spending plans, but the FT recently reported the TV+ budget has grown from $1B to $6B. Looking at current global and US subs from AMZN & NFLX as well as EVR ISI long-term estimates, we think the TV+ opportunity could range from ~$4.5B (current AMZN video subscribers) to ~$17.4B (NFLX global Source: FactSet subs 2022E). The top 5 games on the App Store have ~120M weekly active users (~13% of iPhone install base), which we think is a good benchmark for the long-term Arcade opportunity. At the $4.99 price, this would represent ~$7B in revenue. Donâ€™t Underestimate Photo/Video Upgrades: Apple announced three new iPhones and changed the nomenclature for the high-end phones, which are now referred to as the iPhone Pro ($999) & Pro Max ($1099), while the iPhone 11 is the successor to the iPhone XR. Most of the reveal concentrated on the new cameras and machine learning enabled applications (night mode). Photo applications are among the fastest growing app store revenue generators (100% CAGR 2015-2018). Please see the analyst certification and important disclosures on page 5 of this report.

Net, we forecast 3% revenue growth and 8% EPS growth in FY20 after declines in FY19. We see both structural and product cycle drivers of multiple expansion. Apple's P/E multiple has expanded by just over 4 turns since 2012 as Services tripled from 9% to 30% of gross profit dollars (Exhibit 5), and we see further multiple expansion as Services continue to outpace overall growth. What's more, AAPL's P/E multiple typically expands several turns in the 9-12 months ahead of a major iPhone cycle (Exhibit 6). Our $247 12-month PT implies 19.5x FY20 P/E (18.4x CY20), up from ~17x today. Apple Special Event offered some upside surprises.

Lastly, we expected improved camera and battery technology but the improvements in photo quality and battery life were very significant - for instance 4 to 5 hour longer iPhone 11 Pro / Max battery life compares to less than one hour average improvement in the last two product cycles. Importantly, recent survey results show camera quality and battery life are two of the top three features consumers consider when upgrading their smartphone (Exhibit 7). New Services pricing / bundling more aggressive than expected. Apple opened today's special event with a focus on Services including key details for the Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ launches. Most surprising was Apple's pricing strategy for Apple TV+. Not only is Apple undercutting other OTT video services by offering Apple TV+ at $4.99/month (for up to 6 users, with a 7-day free trial; Exhibit 8), they are also offering a year of TV+ for free to customers that purchase any iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV or iPod Touch. While this may dampen near-term revenue contribution expectations for the streaming video service, it allows Apple to effectively build a base of millions of free-trial users that can convert to paying users as Apple ramps and rolls out new content beyond the 8 original series expected at the November 1st launch. With Apple Arcade, many of the details covered by the press ahead of today's event were in-line with Apple's announcement today, and Apple Arcade will be available to customers in over 150 countries for $4.99/month starting September 19th with a free 1-month trial. iPhone 11 addresses key customer pain points in camera and battery. According to our survey of this year's Morgan Stanley North America summer intern class, battery life and camera quality ranked as the #1 and #3 most important features when purchasing a new smartphone (Exhibit 7), which is broadly consistent with past survey work we have done with a wider sample size (see here). The new iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max add a rear-facing triple camera with 4x optical zoom, rivaling high-end smartphone competitors, and a rear-facing dual camera on the lower priced iPhone 11. Similarly, the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max features 4 and 5 hours of additional battery life relative to their respective predecessors, the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. On the pricing front, Apple kept pricing of the highest end SKUs consistent with last year, but lowered the starting price of the iPhone 11 by $50 at each storage capacity compared to XR a year ago, while lowering the price of the iPhone XR, 8 Plus and 8 by a minimum of $150 which compares to a lower $100 price cut a year ago (Exhibit 9). With the trade-in of a 2-year-old device, customers can get $300 (iPhone 8) to $400 (iPhone X) in credit towards a new iPhone purchase, which we expect will continue to be a popular program to help subsidize iPhone upgrades (June Q iPhone trade-in volume was 5x the year ago quarter). While we're not changing our FY20 iPhone unit (-2% Y/Y) and ASP (also -2% Y/Y) assumptions at this point, we see the most upside to units given elongated replacement cycles, easier compares in China, and the significant camera and battery upgrades in the iPhone 11 line-up. Functional improvement come to the iPad and Apple Watch. Today's iPad and Apple Watch announcements were less about revolutionary hardware upgrades and more about subtle feature enhancements that will drive an improved experience when paired with the new iPadOS and WatchOS announced at WWDC in June. For example, the Apple Watch Series 5 will feature a new display that is always on, allowing you to see important data on the home screen at all 5552 times, as well as new compass app that developers can tap into, all without an impact to battery life. Watch pricing is consistent with last year's Watch Series 4 launch with a broader array of case and band designs. Apple also lowered the price of the 2-year-old Apple Watch Series 3 to just $199, in-line with the pricing of lower-end smartwatches. The new iPad takes advantage of multi-tasking features in iPadOS with a larger 10.2"" retina display (vs. 9.7"" previously) and 3x the pixels, 2x processor speed than the top-selling laptop on the market today. The new iPad price starts at $329, in-line with its predecessor. 5563"

While growth in Services revenue through leverage of the large and growing installed base is key to the investment story for Apple, we believe Apple can still continue to drive growth in hardware revenues through continued increases in both volumes and pricing for an updated Apple watch and other hardware devices (including potentially HomePods).

Net/net: Our flat FY20 iPhone revenue Q2        $61       $58A        $61        estimate reflects our view that the iPhone 11 upgrade cycle will be Q3        $53       $54A        $57        muted due to limited incremental functionality and anticipation of 5G Q4        $63        $63        $68 model in latter half of CY20.

The new high-end iPhones will likely come in two sizes (5.8â€ & 6.1â€), consistent with the iPhone XS & XS Max. Pricing is expected to remain consistent at $999/$1,099. The main change expected in this 1 Year Price History                                              yearâ€™s phones is the addition of a third camera (ultra wide angle lens) which will improve low-light photos and correction. The updated iPhone 11R will continue to have a LCD display and will get a 2nd camera. Finally, we expect AAPL may cease supporting 3D touch functionality and there is potential we get bilateral charging functionality on the new models. Apple Watch: Apple released the Watch Series 4 last year and there are no major hardware changes expected with this yearâ€™s watch. Instead, changes will concentrate on software with new applications including a sleep tracking app. Also, we expect new cases (ceramic) to be launched. Source: FactSet Possible Services Announcement: Itâ€™s possible Apple will use the event to announce details on its upcoming services offerings including Apple TV+ & Apple Arcade. Apple has not released pricing details or a launch date for either service. EVR AAPL Thesis: While we understand iPhone units (and sales) will remain muted through FY20 (5G launch), the narrative has and continues to shift towards services and a higher mix of recurring revenue for AAPL. Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables 2-4% share reduction, and d) non iPhone hardware sales inflect higher and have better margins.

App Store net revenue growth accelerated to +25.8% Y/Y in August from +18.9% in July, representing the strongest Y/Y growth since February 2018 and the third largest month-to-month acceleration in Y/Y growth since early 2015, according to data from Sensor Tower (Exhibit 1). Results were very well-rounded, with each of the 10 largest markets posting an acceleration in Y/Y growth from July (Exhibit 2), and 16 of 23 App Store categories posting an acceleration in Y/Y growth from July, including 7 of the 10 largest categories (and the 3 largest categories). In China, total App Store spend grew 31.8% Y/Y, a considerable acceleration from just 4.8% Y/Y growth 2 months ago, with total Gaming revenue in China growing 29.1% Y/Y in August vs. 21.0% Y/Y in July and 1.0% Y/Y in June (Exhibit 3). As a reminder, due to the gaming license suspension in China this time last year, comps will continue to ease into quarter-end in China, and September 2019 will be lapping a -4.1% Y/Y comp vs. a +4.9% Y/Y comp in August (China gaming, which represents 79% of China App Store spend, faces a -11.7% Y/Y comp in September vs. a -1.7% Y/Y comp in August). The Entertainment category, which is the second largest next to Gaming and represents 7% of T12M App Store spend, posted 28.0% Y/Y growth in August, a meaningful acceleration from 8.3% Y/Y growth in July, despite the continued concern among bears that large entertainment companies bypassing the App Store billing platform will become more widespread and drive a deceleration in Entertainment App Store revenue growth. Quarter-to-date through August, we estimate the App Store has generated $2.9B in net revenue, up 22.4% Y/Y and well ahead of our +18% Y/Y growth forecast for the September quarter.

China Lapping Gaming Approval Headwinds: Developer revenue from China grew 32% in August, well above the 11% rate from the first seven months of the year. Gaming revenue was a key growth driver as the prior year was negatively impacted by China pausing all regulatory approval for new games. This trend will likely continue next quarter and into FY20.

We estimate ~20% Services growth is driven by a combination of increased monetization of install base, growth in user count, and new offerings. Fundamentally, AAPL's Services business is a critical part of the investment thesis, particularly as the smartphone market matures.

Net/net: We think India Q4        $63        $63        $68 opportunity could be an incremental upside driver and assuming FY       $266       $259       $272 AAPL can extend their share from ~0.5% to ~4% over the next few EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.45 years, it would suggest 12M units and rev/EPS upside of 4.6B/$0.65.

However, the market for premium smartphones ($500+) was the fastest growing in CY18, up 44% y/y vs the overall market up 14.5%. While premium smartphones are currently only ~3% 1 Year Price History                                              of the overall market, their share should continue to grow over the long-term as incomes rise. Online smartphone sales grew ~30% in CY18 and now account for almost half of total smartphone sales. Top 5 vendors in India are currently Xiaomi, Samsung, vivo, OPPO, and Transsion, with the 5th vendor shipping 6.4M units vs. AAPL shipping 1.8M units. AAPLâ€™s upside potential: We estimate AAPL ships ~1.5M units in India with an ASP around $775 to the extent AAPL is able to offer a broader range of products and services, without tariffs, there could be an upside potential here. Simplistically, if AAPL can get their share up towards 4% range (vs. 9% China share) it would imply rev/EPS upside Source: FactSet                                                   of $4.6B/$0.65. We do think a more salient feature of this dynamic and AAPLâ€™s ability to operate their flagship stores in India will be brand awareness and a better way to display not just iPhones but the broader ecosystem â€“ we think this dynamic enabled to the LT success in China. India looking to take advantage of Trade War: On Wednesday, India announced two changes to its laws governing foreign companies. The announcement comes as India has begun to ramp up efforts to lure companies looking to shift manufacturing out of China. Apple has spent years lobbying for both changes and the ongoing effort by the Indian Government to attract foreign companies should help Apple expand its customer base in the fast growing country.

We estimate iPhone owners use Apple Pay for less than five percent of their total credit/debit purchases, though our analysis suggests >40% have Apple Pay Earnings Summary                                                  enabled on their iPhone.

Apple Pay is increasingly becoming integrated into Q3        $53        $54        $57        the US transit system which should help drive further adoption (transit Q4        $63        $63        $68        integration caused adoption to spike in international markets).

Q3      $2.34      $2.18       $2.45       We think Apple Pay and ancillary services could end-up being a Q4      $2.91      $2.83       $3.31       $5.0B+ revenue stream over the next few years, given the high FY     $11.87     $11.66      $12.93 gross/operating margin structure this could be an incremental $0.80- $1.00 of EPS contribution over the next 3-4 years. Sticking with our OP rating and $238 target. 1 Year Price History Apple Pay used for under 5% of iPhone owner transactions: Per the Federal Reserve, the average American adult completes ~380 credit/debit card transactions per year. Using the global iPhone user base of ~900m implies iPhone owners complete ~340B transactions per year. Apple indicated on the most recent earnings call that Pay has hit a run rate of ~1B transactions per month (implies 12B per year or ~3% of estimated 340B). Our FY20 Apple Pay estimate of $1.5B assumes transaction volumes grow to ~19B or ~6% of total iPhone owner transactions. Framing the Upside Narrative: We think Apple Pay revenue could grow to over $5B in the next few years, adding ~$0.80-$1.00 in Source: FactSet incremental EPS. Our $5B estimate assumes Apple Pay is used in ~20% of total iPhone user transactions (~$68B in total transaction volume). Apple Card & Transit Spurring Adoption: After a week of Apple card use, we are impressed with the user experience & privacy features. Greater efforts to integrate Pay into transit should also support growth, particularly in the US where Pay adoption remains low. The NY Subway was added to the list of places to use Apple Pay in June, joining recently added Portland and Chicago. Apple has previously noted that international use of Apple Pay increased significantly after transit integration in London, Moscow, Beijing and Tokyo.

The low end of our 4- 20% range Q3      $2.34      $2.18       $2.45       assumes 10% tariffs with ~50% of costs passed on to the customer Q4      $2.91      $2.83       $3.31 while the high end assumes 25% tariffs and 100% of costs absorbed FY     $11.87     $11.66      $12.93 by AAPL. Apple Card: This week Apple began sending out invites to apply for 1 Year Price History                                              Apple Card. The card should help drive Apple Pay adoption, as it offers 2% cash back on purchases made with Apple Pay. We are currently forecasting Apple Pay revenue of ~$1.5B in FY20, almost 3x our FY18 estimate of ~$0.6B. The Morning Show: The trailer was the first look at what should be a high-profile Apple TV show starring Jennifer Anniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell. Apple TV will launch this fall and faces some tough competition from existing (Netflix, Prime, Hulu) and upcoming (Disney+, HBO Max, AT&T TV). Despite the competition, we think Apple TV should be able to gain traction as it focuses on producing a limited amount of high-quality content vs. the Netflix Source: FactSet shotgun approach. Apple already has deals lined up with some major Hollywood names, including Spielberg, Oprah, Kumail Nanjiani, and JJ Abrams. EVR AAPL Thesis: While we understand iPhone units (and sales) will remain muted through FY20 (5G launch), the narrative has and continues to shift towards services and a higher mix of recurring revenue for AAPL. Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables 2-4% share reduction, and d) non iPhone hardware sales inflect higher and have better margins.

While we cited slowing consumer demand resulting from US/China trade tensions as the cause, the slowdown appears more transitory in nature with tougher Y/Y compares and fewer gaming license approvals the more likely explanation for the slowdown in June. App Store revenue reaccelerated in the month of July to +19% Y/Y (Exhibit 1) on the back of growth in China meaningfully reaccelerating to 20% Y/Y in July (Exhibit 2). Similarly, growth in China gaming App Store net revenue accelerated to +21% Y/Y growth in July, from +1% Y/Y growth in June. Of the App Store's 5 largest markets - China, US, Japan, Great Britain and Taiwan - 3 posted a Y/Y acceleration (China, US, Taiwan) in net revenue growth in July, while the others posted a slight deceleration in growth, but still grew over 16% Y/Y. Based on the data, we also estimate that total App Store download growth slightly accelerated to +4% Y/Y in July (from +3% in the June quarter) while total spend per download accelerated by 4 percentage points to +15% Y/Y in July, pointing to a healthy underlying mobile app ecosystem. It is admittedly too early to make a call on September quarter App Store results, especially considering the current geopolitical environment, but July App Store results represents a positive start to the quarter considering we currently model total App Store growth of 18% Y/Y in C3Q19 and comps get easier over the next 2 months (importantly, China gaming spend faces -1.7% Y/Y and -11.7% Y/Y comps in the months of August and September compared to a +3.4% comp in July).

Sticking with our OP rating and $237 target as we think AAPL is Q4        $63        $63        $68        well positioned to sustain double digit EPS growth over the next few FY       $266       $259       $272        years and we see potential for POSITIVE revenue growth in FY20 & EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.45       FY21. Q2      $2.73     $2.46A       $2.72 Q3      $2.34      $2.18       $2.45       Off-Balance Sheet Components: AAPLâ€™s manufacturing and Q4      $2.91      $2.83       $3.31       component purchase commitments stood at $29.8B (vs. $31.4B as of FY     $11.87     $11.66      $12.93       June 2018). Notably, the manufacturing and component commitments reflect AAPLâ€™s desire and need to co-invest with its strategic supply- chain partners in order to ensure availability of capacity. We also note 1 Year Price History                                              that AAPL has vendor non-trade receivables of $12.3B up from $11.1B last qtr. These are receivables from EMS partners resulting from AAPL selling components to EMS companies who manufacture and assemble the final product. Warranty & FX: AAPL recorded warranty accruals of $548M (-6% q/q, -3.3% y/y). We estimate the q/q change in accrued warranty positively helped gross margin by <10bps (after seasonality). Accruals for product warranty were 1.0% of total revenues, slightly lower than the past 3 years average level. In Jun-qtr AAPL saw $50M of f/x hedging headwinds - $68M in revenue, $13M in cost of sales and $5M in Other income. We think these hedges had a minor gross-margin headwind of ~7bps (vs. 37.6% reported gross margin). Source: FactSet Regional Performance: AAPL saw operating margin y/y declines across all regions. However, the Americas (29.7%) and China (35.2%) saw the smallest declines at -84bps and -57bps, respectively. The company saw a 340bps margin decline in Asia-Pac (32.2%), 167bps margin decline in Japan (28.0%), and 115bps margin decline in Europe (30.9%) and 415bps margin increase in Japan (44.8%). Lawsuits: In April 2019, Apple & Qualcomm reached an agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide. Apple didnâ€™t disclose the QCOM payment amount. Apple is still involved in ongoing litigation with Virtnex over allegations Apple has infringed upon Virtnex patents. Capex: Apple revised its capex target from $12.0B to $10.0B, which is down 25% y/y vs FY18 actual ($13.3B). Please see the analyst certification and important disclosures on page 6 of this report.

Q3        $53        $54        $57        Bulls Say: 1) Services & Wearables Driving Growth: Services sales of Q4        $63        $63        $68 $11.5bn (12.6% y/y and 0.0% q/q), excluding a large one-time item FY       $266       $259       $272 from FQ3:18, services revenue grew 15% y/y (+18% ex-fx).

Bears Say: 1) iPhones units: iPhone sales were down 12% y/y and will likely decline again in the sept-qtr as well. This could create risk to the model as we go forward, 2) Next iPhone cycle concerns: Bears will argue that iPhone sales/units will decline through the next cycle ensuring street numbers continue to head lower on a multi quarter basis, 3) Services deceleration: The headline number at 13% growth is a concern and shows deceleration, 4) Valuation: Stock is trading above the historical ranges of its valuation on P/E basis now. EVR AAPL Thesis: While we understand iPhone units (and sales) will remain muted through FY20 (5G launch), the narrative has and Source: FactSet                                                   continues to shift towards services and a higher mix of recurring revenue for AAPL. Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables 2-4% share reduction, and d) non iPhone hardware sales inflect higher and have better margins. EVR ISI Sept-qtr Estimates & Beyond: For Sept-qtr, our revenue/EPS estimates of $62.9B/$2.83 are above consensus of ($62.0B/$2.77).

Led by the strong momentum exiting F3Q19, we expect these headwinds to continue to moderate further (JPMe F4Q19 iPhone revenue -11%), with possible upside opportunities. We are raising our F4Q19 iPhone volume outlook to ~43 mn units (vs. 42 mn prior), although we see potential upside to the high-end of the firmâ€™s F4Q19 revenue guide, which we estimate implies 44 to 45 mn units.

Even incorporating slower Services growth relative to our prior model due to FX headwinds and difficult Apple Care comps our FY19 EPS increases to $11.68 (from $11.54) while our FY20 EPS remains unchanged at $12.68. What we learned from Apple's F3Q19 earnings report: We expected in-line June results and in-line to better September quarter guidance, which largely played out. Below we highlight areas that surprised versus our model or against recent trends and investor sentiment. (=/-) Services growth stable, but didn't accelerate. The only real disappointment in the quarter was the fact that accelerating App Store growth, which we wrote about earlier this month and was confirmed by management, didn't flow through to an acceleration in total Services growth as a result of 300bps of currency         Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with headwinds and difficult Y/Y compares in Apple Care due to distribution channel        companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a expansion in 2018. That said, June quarter normalized Services growth of 15.3%        result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Y/Y equates to roughly 18% Y/Y Services growth in CC, which is consistent with        Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider March quarter constant currency Services growth and reflects a stronger               Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their investment decision. underlying trend than as-reported numbers imply. In the quarter, App Store,           For analyst certification and other important disclosures, Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Care all grew double digits Y/Y, while App Store        refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this report. Search Ads (in the Licensing & Other line in our Services model) and Apple Pay 87 1 grew triple digits Y/Y. We still expect easing App Store comps in China as well as new Services, starting with Apple Card launching in August, to contribute incremental Services revenue in C2H19, and model Services growth accelerating to 17% Y/Y in C2H19, from 16% Y/Y in C1H19. Management confirmed that new media services, like TV+, will be revenue generating versus bundled with hardware as some investors expected, but free trials will delay the revenue ramp, likely by a quarter. (+) iPhone stabilizing as emerging markets recover and replacement cycles near peak. Emerging markets grew in the June quarter, with the BRIC countries growing 3% Y/Y after declining 25% Y/Y in F1H19, and Mainland China specifically growing Y/Y on an as reported basis and Greater China growing in CC, the biggest contributor to the 5 point improvement in iPhone revenue growth from the March quarter. We believe there is limited downside to iPhone growth near-term as replacement cycles stabilize (Exhibit 1) and approach levels of the mature PC market which has normalized at roughly a 4 year device life. Our September quarter iPhone unit estimate is unchanged at 43M, driving total iPhone revenue of $32.6B and implying the Y/Y iPhone growth trajectory continues to improve (to -11% Y/Y, from -12% Y/Y in the June Q) as we approach the next iPhone cycle. (+) Wearables becoming a meaningful growth driver. Wearables, Home and Accessories growth accelerated to 48% Y/Y (with Wearables alone growing >50% Y/Y) and now accounts for 10% of Apple revenue vs. 7% in the June 2018 quarter. When combined with Services, these two segments account for 32% of revenue that is tied to iPhone user base but not necessarily new device sales. As a result, we expect smoother revenue seasonality as evidenced by the better than expected June results (0.8% above Street) and September 2019 (2.5% above Street at the midpoint) revenue guidance. (+) Operating leverage returning to the model. The September quarter marks the first quarter since December 2017 that Apple has guided to a sequential improvement in gross margins, which we attribute to lower memory costs and an overall mix shift towards Services, where we model a gross margin of 64.3% in the September Q. Additionally, Apple guided September quarter OpEx up less than 1% Q/Q (or less than $67M) at the midpoint, the lowest Q/Q OpEx growth in a September quarter since 2013, a testament to the scalability of the revenue base (most notably Services) and cost planning after the December quarter weakness that is now flowing through the model. Management noted that they will continue to invest competitively in R&D and to support new product launches with marketing and advertising, so we don't view the September quarter OpEx guide as an indicator that future OpEx growth will take a step function lower, but rather that revenue growth is returning to the model and driving operating leverage. 88 2"

Momentum Sustain. ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW: AAPL reported upside to Jun-qtr results and guided Sept-qtr results above the street on both sales and EPS. Strength in Jun-qtr was driven by a) iPhone revenues (-13% y/y), b) Services revenues came in at ~$11.5B, +20% y/y, and c) sustained growth in the wearables category, +48% y/y growth. From a geographic basis, we note Americas was down 9% y/y, Europe, Japan and China were all down ~20% y/y. Sept-qtr guide implies ~16% q/q revenue growth and gross margins shifting modestly higher in the 37.5-38.5% range, both revenues and implied EPS for Sept-qtr is well ahead of street expectations. Jun-qtr Print Results/Sept-qtr Guide: AAPL reported Jun-qtr results that were above expectations with a print of $53.8B/$2.16 (Street at $53.3B/$2.09). The companyâ€™s Sept-qtr guide is modestly ahead of the street, with AAPL guiding FQ3 sales of $61- 64B and EPS at ~$2.80 (Street at $60.9B/$2.66 for Sept-qtr) and implies sales are up ~16% sequentially. Sept-qtr guidance calls for: 1) Gross-margins of 37.5-38.5%, up 20bps q/q vs. Jun-qtr at 37.8%. Jun-qtr gross margins came in above street expectations of 37.6% while Sept-qtr GM guide is above consensus expectations of 37.7%. 2) iPhone revenue of $25.9B declined 16% was modestly below consensus estimate of $26.3B 3) China was down -20% y/y & down 10% q/q, 4) Services revenue of $11.5B was up 20% y/y and came in with consensus, and 5) Cash flow from operations was strong at $11.6B. Key Focus Items Heading into the Call â€“ 1) iPhone: Investors will be looking for details around weakness in iPhone sales, market share, mix and units given AAPL's new disclosure policy, 2) Other & Mac acceleration: Both are notably and clarity on if this is sustainable? 3) China: Dynamics around both services and revenue (iphone) trends. 4) Jony Ive/Design Team: We expect questions around Ive's departure & ongoing relationship with AAPL, 5) Gross Margin: Puts and takes from iPhone declines/price cuts, mix changes, services growth, NAND pricing & FX impact, and 6) Pepper/Spotify Lawsuits: Any updates to ongoing legal challenges or consideration of changes to App Store fee?

Apple noted fx negatively impacted revenue growth by ~300bps. iPhone: AAPL reported iPhone sales of $26.0bn (-11.8% y/y), slightly below consensus of $26.3bn. The 12% y/y decline was an improvement from the 17% decline in the Mar-qtr. The relative improvement was driven by Appleâ€™s new trade-in/financing programs and a recovery in China (ex-fx China iPhone revenue was up y/y). Apple noted the iPhone install base grew in each of its top 20 markets, with the global install base hitting an all-time high. Source: FactSet Services: AAPL reported Services sales of $11.5bn (12.6% y/y and 0.0% q/q). Excluding a large one-time item from FQ3:18, services revenue grew 15% y/y (+18% ex-fx). Apple noted Services strength was broad based with most segments and regions hitting all-time high revenues. Other Products: AAPL reported iPad sales of $5.0bn (+8.4% y/y and 3.1% q/q). Mac sales in the quarter were $5.8bn (10.7% y/y and 5.6% q/q). Wearables, home, and accessories revenue grew 48.0% y/y to $5.5B.

Appleâ€™s current generation iPhones retail for $749-$1099. On its FQ1:19 earnings call, Apple disclosed that the iPhone install base now exceeds 900m active users. iPhone Refresh Cycle: Since the launch of the original iPhone, Apple has updated the product annually and has redesigned the iPhone every two years. The elongation of the iPhone refresh cycle has become central to the bearish narrative as recent redesigns have offered minimal incremental functionality. We think refresh demand will likely remain muted until Apple unveils a 5G compatible model (expected in 2020). iPhone Growth Trajectory: A commonly cited reason for iPhone declines is the lack of compelling new-features on the iPhone XR. Assuming this was a key driver of iPhone declines, FY16 provides a solid precedent for estimating the recovery that can be expected when the iPhone 11 is released. Apple released the iPhone 6s at the end of FY15 and it was largely a disappointment with few improvements vs. the iPhone 6. Limited demand for the 6s ultimately drove a 12% decline in FY16 iPhone revenue, slightly less than our forecasted 15% decline in FY19. iPhone revenue recovered after the release of the iPhone 7, growing 3% in FY17 and 18% in FY18 with the release of the iPhone X. Currently, we estimate iPhone revenue to be ~flat in FY20, so we are not assuming a FY20 recovery in iPhone sales following the release of the iPhone 11 as we think the refresh cycle will remain elongated until Apple releases a 5G model.

Fun Fact â€“ FY     $11.87     $11.36      $12.34       AAPL has guided forward quarter revenues inline w/ the street 9x in the last 20 quarters. The trend is not your friend here. Buyside Expectations: Investors expect largely in line to modestly 1 Year Price History                                              softer revenues for June-qtr vs. street at $53.2B (guide is at $52.5- 54.5B). From a segment perspective, iPhone revenues are expected to decline low-teens (down 13-15% range), services is expected to be up modestly q/q (~mid 11B range, $12B would be notable upside). Most think gross-margins are towards the low-end of 37.5-38.0% range (something around 38% would be upside). In terms of Sept-qtr guide, we think investors are expecting revenues to be guided below the street: the ranges we think for Sept-qtr are: revenues in the $58- 60B range (street modestly above the high-end), GMâ€™s are expected to be guided 37.5-38.0% (this is debated, if they guide this up would be positive) and implied EPS anticipated around $2.50 (street at $2.66). Source: FactSet Key Focus Points: 1) services and its trajectory going forward, 2) China centric demand commentary on hardware and services, 3) gross-margin dynamics going forward, 4) tariff impact and offsets heading into H2 and 5) channel inventory and implications for next product launch. EVR ISI Estimates: Our June-qtr revenue/EPS estimates of $52.5B/$2.07 are largely in-line with consensus. For FY19, our revenue estimate of $256B is slightly above consensus of $255B and our EPS estimate of $11.36 is slightly below consensus.

We expect a tough growth compare to drive the Services growth rate to moderate to +13% y/y in F3Q, before re-accelerating led by the launch of a broader group of services already announced this year and with a greater mix of revenues attributable to Apple (News+, expansion of Apple Music to live events, Apple Card, Gaming, TV). Despite the deceleration, we are more encouraged by the rebound in mobile game downloads, in turn driving a rebound in overall App Store downloads, as reported by Sensor Tower and corroborated by Tencent results (please see page 4 for detailed Sensor Tower data on App Store trends).

While 52-Week Range                             $142.00 - $233.47       we fully realize these are production plans not sales figures and much Fiscal Year End                                         Sep can change depending on pricing strategy and product details it is notable that, at least at the onset, AAPLâ€™s plans this year are comparable to what they had last year. For reference, a similar story Earnings Summary                                                  was published in June 2018 stating Apple told suppliers to prepare for 2018      2019E      2020E        ~80m units (we estimate AAPL sold ~70M new iPhones in H2:18). Revenue (B)            Q1        $88       $84A        $87        Overall, this implies Apple is not expecting much of a lift from the Q2        $61       $58A        $61        iPhone 11; however, there may still be upside vs consensus Q3        $53        $52        $56        expectations which call for a ~6% decline in units shipped relative to Q4        $63        $61        $64 2H:CY18. Expectations are already low for the iPhone 11 as few FY       $266       $256       $267 investors expect the iPhone to return to high growth until the release EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.35 of a 5G model. Net/Net: We maintain our OP rating and $227 target Q2      $2.73     $2.46A       $2.64 Q3      $2.34      $2.07       $2.37       on AAPL as we see a confluence of a) services acceleration, b) gross- Q4      $2.91      $2.65       $2.97       margin upside, c) capital allocation and d) reasonable Sept-qtr bogey FY     $11.87     $11.36      $12.34       as enablers for stock upside. iPhone 11 Details: Apple is expected to unveil three new models in September with minimal upgrades vs the most recent generation. The 1 Year Price History                                              most notable changes will be a new, higher-powered camera & processor which may not be enough to drive consumers to spend ~$1k on an upgrade. Longer-term, we expect the first 5G iPhone model to drive a return to growth. EVR ISI Thesis on AAPL: While we understand iPhone units (and sales) will remain muted through FY20 (5G launch), the narrative has and continues to shift towards services and a higher mix of recurring revenue for AAPL. Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables Source: FactSet                                                   2-4% share reduction, and d) non iPhone hardware sales inflect higher and have better margins. EVR Estimates For Jun-qtr and Beyond: For Jun-qtr, our revenue/EPS estimates of $52.5B/$2.07 are slightly below consensus ($53.3B/$2.09). For FY19 our estimates of $256B/$11.36 are also slightly below consensus ($257B/$11.40). EVR View on Services: Investors have been focused more on iPhone trends and less focused on AAPL's ability to grow/ monetize the install base. We estimate ~20% Services growth is driven by a combination of increased monetization of install base, growth in user count, and new offerings. Fundamentally, AAPL's Services business is a critical part of the investment thesis, particularly as the smartphone market matures.

We think Average 10-Day Volume (M)                            18,597       there are three key points here: 1) AAPL could make more headway Enterprise Value (B)                                   $869       on 5G modems, given logically they have no desire to make a 52-Week Range                             $142.00 - $233.47       â€œprofitable modemâ€, which clearly INTC as a public company needed Fiscal Year End                                         Sep to â€“ this could help enable AAPL to make the relevant investments in people and technology more aggressively, 2) AAPL continues to shift toward owning/designing more semiconductor products. Recall they Earnings Summary                                                  did a comparable deal with Dialog semiconductor for $600M, 3) At 2018      2019E      2020E        minimum, the rationale (from AAPLâ€™s perspective) to have an Revenue (B)            Q1        $88       $84A        $87        alternative solution to QCOM is fairly logical. 4) Financially, AAPL is Q2        $61       $58A        $61        taking on 2,200 employees â€“ assuming no revenue, we estimate the Q3        $53        $52        $56        annual EPS impact is ~4-6c EPS headwind (to ~$12 EPS run-rate). Q4        $63        $61        $64 Net/net: We maintain our OP rating on AAPL with a $227 target as we FY       $266       $256       $267 see the stock continuing to work higher driven by a) services EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.35 acceleration, b) gross margin tailwinds, c) capital allocation/buyback Q2      $2.73     $2.46A       $2.64 Q3      $2.34      $2.07       $2.37       momentum, and d) potential for multiple expansion. Q4      $2.91      $2.65       $2.97 Modems High Portion of BOM: Our Semiconductor analyst (CJ FY     $11.87     $11.36      $12.34 Muse) estimates that QCOM baseband models and related royalty payments account for >$37/device, suggesting this is a sizable part of iPhone BOM to target. The >$37 estimate assumes a royalty of $7 1 Year Price History                                              and a slim modem ASP of ~$30 with millimeter wave/other 5G tech potentially taking ASPs above $30. While it is unclear if AAPL could truly build a scalable 5G modem in-house, we think strategically it is important for AAPL to have multiple suppliers for key components especially given the history of litigation between AAPL and QCOM. Deal Details: AAPL announced that Intel and AAPL have signed an agreement for Apple to acquire the majority of Intelâ€™s smartphone modem business. ~2,200 Intel employees will join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. The transaction, valued at $1 billion, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019. Combining the acquired patents for current and future wireless Source: FactSet                                                   technology with Appleâ€™s existing portfolio, Apple will hold over 17,000 wireless technology patents, ranging from protocols for cellular standards to modem architecture and modem operation. Intel will retain the option to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, internet of things devices and autonomous vehicles.

Fundamentally, we think AAPL Q2        $61       $58A        $61        should be relatively shielded from these issues â€“ given they donâ€™t Q3        $53        $52        $56        really have a â€œdominantâ€ position in any marketplace and vast majority Q4        $63        $61        $64 of their profits come from hardware-centric sales (not from selling FY       $266       $256       $267 consumer data). Net/Net: While this bound to be an overhang, we EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.35 donâ€™t see this altering the fundamental trajectory for AAPL.

Maintain OP rating. FY     $11.87     $11.36      $12.34 What is the DOJ Looking Into? The DOJ announced they are reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have 1 Year Price History                                              reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers. There is no defined end-goal yet for the Big Tech review other than to understand whether there are antitrust problems that need addressing. Why We Think This is â€œNoiseâ€? 1) No Monopoly: AAPL does not have monopolistic share in any of the categories they are involved in from PCs (sub 10% share) to mobile devices (sub 20% share) to Tablets (sub 25%), so there is no â€œhardwareâ€ dominant position to fixate upon, 2) App Store: We donâ€™t think AAPLâ€™s take-rate has reduced the competitiveness in the App development community, there are more Apps today vs. 1 year ago vs. 5 years, so whatever Source: FactSet                                                   AAPL is doing isnâ€™t creating scarcity of assets (or Apps), 3) AAPL vs. SPOT: While we sort of understand the concern that AAPL shouldnâ€™t be selling competing goods, we think this is comparable to asking WMT or Whole Foods to not sell private label products. Letâ€™s Do Downside Math: 1) Apple is forced to alter the App Store fee model, and 2) Apple is forced to divest Apple Music. In a scenario where Apple would be required to raise App Store gross revenue payouts (to 75%-95% vs. 70% currently) to third party developers, we see potential for 2% to 11% unfavorable EPS impact. The Apple vs. Pepper decision is a procedural ruling for now and we think the financial impact from this case (if any) could take several years to materialize.

While AAPL has tried to do this in the past and Fiscal Year End                                         Sep even partnered with INTC to build modems for iPhone X and XS models with significant allocations, they recently settled their dispute with QCOM to ensure 5G modem supply. Our Semiconductor analyst Earnings Summary                                                  (CJ Muse) estimates that QCOM baseband models and related 2018      2019E      2020E        royalty payments account for >$37/device, suggesting this is a sizable Revenue (B)            Q1        $88       $84A        $87        part of iPhone BOM to target.

While it is unclear if AAPL could Q4        $63        $61        $64 truly build a scalable 5G modem in-house, we think strategically it is FY       $266       $256       $267 important for AAPL to have multiple suppliers for key components EPS                    Q1      $3.89     $4.18A       $4.35 especially given the history of litigation between AAPL and QCOM.

What Are The Media Outlets Reporting? The WSJ is reporting that 1 Year Price History                                              AAPL is looking to acquire INTCâ€™s struggling modem business for $1.0B and a deal could be reached next week. The deal would give AAPL access to the engineering work and talent behind INTCâ€™s multi- year push to develop modem chips, most notably for next generation (think 5G) devices. We note that INTC announced it was exiting this business soon after AAPLâ€™s decision to settle with QCOM. Something else worth highlighting is that a few months back AAPL hired Mr. Messay Amerga, an executive in charge of Intelâ€™s wireless modem technology arm, who was leading efforts to develop a 5G Modem for INTC. Mr. Amerga was at INTC for ~2 years and prior to that spent ~19 years at QCOM according to his LinkedIn profile. Source: FactSet                                                   EVR ISI Thesis on AAPL: While we understand iPhone units (and sales) will remain muted through FY20 (5G launch), the narrative has and continues to shift towards services and a higher mix of recurring revenue for AAPL. Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables 2-4% share reduction, and d) non iPhone hardware sales inflect higher and have better margins. EVR Estimates for Jun-qtr and Beyond: For Jun-qtr, our revenue/EPS estimates of $52.5B/$2.07 are slightly below consensus ($53.3B/$2.09). For FY19 our estimates of $256B/$11.36 are also slightly below consensus ($257B/$11.40). Please see the analyst certification and important disclosures on page 3 of this report.

A quantitative analysis of Apple's Taiwanese component supplier results through June suggests Apple's September guidance is likely to come in largely in-line with consensus estimates, corroborating our fundamental view for September quarter expectations. We adjust our June revenue forecast slightly higher to $53.8B (+1% Y/Y; Exhibit 1) on the back of Mac outperformance; otherwise, our estimates are largely unchanged with revenue and EPS slightly higher than consensus (+0.8% and +1.9%, respectively) and gross margin slightly lower than consensus (Exhibit 2). Forecasting a 320bps acceleration in June quarter Services growth on App Store outperformance. We believe the June quarter will mark the first quarter since        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with March 2018 where Services revenue growth accelerates, and we model total             companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a Services revenue of $11.9B, up 16.7% Y/Y as reported, and up 19.5% Y/Y               conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of normalizing for the $236M one-time benefit from the June 2018 quarter vs.            Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making consensus Services forecasts 110bps lower at $11.7B (Exhibit 3). As we wrote         their investment decision. about last week, App Store growth accelerated in the June quarter on easing          For analyst certification and other important disclosures, refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this comps in China, and while the latest Apple Music subscriber count was 4% lower       report. 2071 than our forecast, it represents <10% of Services revenue vs. the App Store at >30% of Services revenue. In our view, this growth acceleration is an important stock catalyst with accelerating Services growth in 2018 tied to multiple expansion (Exhibit 5). We believe improved Services growth can persist through year end on further easing App Store comps in China, and into FY20 on the heels of yet-to-launch (but already announced) Services, which consensus estimates do not appear to currently take into account (Exhibit 6). Investors remain focused on key Services growth risks, including App Store take-rates, competition from cloud gaming, and slowing Google TAC payments. We've addressed these in prior research (here and here) and don't see high likelihood these factors would pressure near-term Services growth. iPhone performance in China likely to be a focus; we believe performance improved in the June quarter. We forecast 37M iPhone shipments in the June quarter (-10% Y/Y) translating to $26.2B iPhone revenue (-11% Y/Y), an improvement from a 17% Y/Y iPhone revenue decline in the March quarter. Our domestic checks remained stable through the quarter but two factors give us confidence that performance in China improved. First, according to data compiled by push-messaging service provider Jiguang, iPhone share of the China smartphone installed base increased Y/Y for the 6th consecutive month in June, growing 96bps Y/Y to 20.0%, a slight improvement from May's 51bps Y/Y installed base gains (Exhibit 7). Second, smartphone shipment data from the Chinese government show international smartphone shipments (essentially Apple and Samsung) declined only 0.9% Y/Y in the June quarter, an improvement from 46.3% Y/Y declines in the March quarter (Exhibit 8), even after incorporating international smartphone shipment declines of over 30% Y/Y in the month of June. While the Chinese government smartphone shipment data does not always correlate with data from third party providers in the US, the directional improvement is notable relative to the March quarter, giving us confidence in our June quarter iPhone forecast. Keeping September quarter estimates largely unchanged with negligible risk to revenue guidance. We forecast September quarter revenue and gross margin of $61.3B (-3% Y/Y) and 37.7% (-60bps Y/Y), respectively, which are largely unchanged from our prior forecasts and in-line-to-below consensus estimates. September quarter iPhone expectations have come down in recent weeks as supply chain analysts have cut iPhone builds to the low 40M range; however, those cuts are largely in-line with our 43M iPhone shipment estimate (-8% Y/Y). Our Greater China Tech Hardware team has a more bullish outlook and recently raised September iPhone builds by 6M units to 48M, driven by legacy model builds. Therefore, we are biased toward higher unit/lower ASP estimates in September, but believe iPhone revenue in September is likely to be relatively in- line with our $32B estimate (-13% Y/Y). On the Services side, we forecast 18% Y/Y growth in the September quarter, a deceleration from our June quarter growth forecast despite easing China gaming comps, again, implying not overly optimistic forecasts for the quarter. We see multiple catalysts into 2020 supporting our Overweight rating; PT moves to $247. The combination of negative investor sentiment, the potential for a Services acceleration in June, and a low bar for September guidance keep us positively biased into earnings. But we believe there is also a clear catalyst path beyond earnings that will help the stock re-rate towards our updated $247 price 2082 target (from $231 previously) over the next 6-9 months, making it a top pick for 2H19. In the near-term, the most important catalyst remains an acceleration in Services revenue growth in C2H19, which is not baked into consensus estimates and which will be aided by the launch (and more details, such as bundling efforts) of the Apple Card, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade, offsetting what is usually a ""sell the news"" event around the September iPhone launch. Exiting 2019, we expect investors to shift focus to the potential 5G iPhone in September 2020. Historically Apple shares begin to price in significant iPhone launches (such as the iPhone 6 launch in 2014 or the iPhone X launch in 2017) up to 9 months ahead of the launch date (Exhibit 9). Importantly, the iPhone replacement cycle now stands at nearly 4 years, in-line with the mature PC market and a structural ceiling in our view. As a result, we see near-term downside to iPhone shipments as more limited than in the past and the potential for an upgrade cycle, like 5G, to have a more meaningful impact to iPhone shipment growth as compared to iPhone X, which was launched at a time when replacement cycles were lengthening due to the shift away from handset subsidies. We roll forward our valuation to FY20 estimates (from CY19) and update our SoTP-driven price target, which rises to $247 (from $231 previously; Exhibit 10). Risks to our view are 1) slowing China data in the month of June which could limit upside in the September quarter, 2) re-escalating US-China trade tensions, 3) law of large numbers catching up with the more mature services like App Store and AppleCare which could offset growth from newer services and easing Y/Y compares in China. 2093"

China Lapping Gaming Approval Headwinds: Developer revenue from China grew 15% in FQ3:19, well above the 4% rate from the first half of the year. Gaming revenue was a key growth driver as the prior year was negatively impacted by China pausing all regulatory approval for new games. This trend will likely continue next quarter and into FY20. EVR View on Services: Investors have been focused more on Source: FactSet iPhone trends and less focused on AAPL's ability to grow/ monetize the install base. We estimate ~20% Services growth is driven by a combination of increased monetization of install base, growth in user count, and new offerings. Fundamentally, AAPL's Services business is a critical part of the investment thesis, particularly as the smartphone market matures.

According to data from Sensor Tower, estimated June quarter App Store net revenue of $3,853M (+17.5% Y/Y) beat our estimate of $3,834M (+17% Y/Y) by 50bps. Importantly, this marks the second consecutive quarter of accelerating App Store growth (Exhibit 2), even after accounting for revisions in the latest Sensor Tower data that increase March quarter App Store growth to +17% Y/Y compared to +15% Y/Y previously. Keeping the rest of our Apple Services forecasts unchanged, this would imply June quarter Services revenue of $11,918M (+17.2% Y/Y or +20.0% Y/Y normalized for the $236M one-time Services benefit in the June 2018 quarter), slightly above our current estimate of $11,899M (+17.0% Y/Y; +19.8% Y/Y normalized) and 1.5% higher than consensus of $11,740M (+15.4% Y/Y; +18.2% Y/Y normalized; Exhibit 3). Below we present our 3 key takeaways from the June quarter App Store data.           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a (+) Improved gaming growth the largest contributor to App Store acceleration.        result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Gaming represents 70% of T12M App Store net revenue and growth accelerated           Morgan Stanley Research.

June marked the first quarter of ""easy"" comps and as such, China gaming net revenue growth accelerated to 12% Y/Y, from just 2% Y/Y growth in the March quarter (Exhibit 5). Going forward, China gaming faces a -4% Y/Y and -1% Y/Y comp in the September and December 2019 quarters, respectively, suggesting China gaming growth can continue to accelerate in the back half of year. Outside of China, the US, Japan and rest of world (ROW) collectively posted gaming growth of at least 11% Y/Y in the June quarter, with the US (24% of gaming revenue) and ROW (21% of gaming revenue) facing easing comps and Japan (24% of gaming revenue) facing more difficult comps as we enter the back half of 2019. (+ / -) App Store revenue diversifying with most segments on improving trajectory. Last quarter we wrote about disconcerting growth trends in the Entertainment segment, the second largest in the App Store (at 7% of T12M App Store net revenue), which has been impacted by large entertainment companies (such as Netflix) bypassing Apple's payment platform to avoid paying the 15%/30% App Store take rate. Bears have pointed to this as a sign that other companies will follow suit (as Spotify has), putting future App Store growth at risk. In the June quarter, Entertainment growth decelerated again to just +12% Y/Y, from +26% Y/Y in the March quarter from over 100% Y/Y only one year ago, however Entertainment was only one of two segments in the top 10 segments (97% of T12M App Store net revenue) to decelerate, along with Productivity apps, the 10th largest segment in the App Store (Exhibit 6). In fact, despite Spotify taking actions to bypass the App Store, Music net revenue (3% of App Store) growth accelerated 630bps to 30% Y/Y in the June quarter, from 24% Y/Y in the March quarter. While gaming remains the core driver of App Store revenue, these other segments continue to become more meaningful contributors to the Apple Store, with the top 10 segments ex-Gaming representing 28% of App Store spend in 2Q18 vs. 25% in 2Q17 and 18% in 2Q16. (-) Trade measures between US and China potentially impacting Chinese consumer demand. On a monthly basis, total App Store net revenue growth slowed through the course of the June quarter, from 21% Y/Y growth in April, to +18% in May and +13% in June. Digging a level deeper, monthly growth trends in the US and Japan (roughly half of App Store net revenue) were either steady or accelerating through the quarter, but China net revenue growth slowed from 19% Y/Y or greater growth in April and May to just 4% Y/Y growth in June (Exhibit 7). While the comps got slightly more difficult in the month of June, slowing consumer demand in China could also tie back to more restrictive trade measures. While Apple iPhone installed base share has held up well in recent months (see the latest here), weaker consumer demand could weigh on app store engagement. July 2019 data, expected to be released the first week of August, will be key to deciphering whether the slowdown is temporary or more structural in nature. 2972 Analysis Exhibit 1: A combination of easing comps in C2H19 and contribution from recently announced services can sustain 18-20% Y/Y Services revenue growth while Consensus currently models decelerating growth.

We are also modestly raising our C2021 shipment estimates to 190 mn vs. 188 mn prior, albeit a slight decline of -5% y/y from the strong replacement cycle in 2020. Looking near-term, we are maintaining our C2019 forecast for ~183 mn units and while we cannot rule out a modest revision to near-term outlook given the volatility in the US-China trade discussions, we see limited risk given the additional levers available to Apple, particularly in the developed markets, to offset such headwinds.

Key levers for upside include: a) services growing double-digits with potential acceleration given new revenue streams, b) gross margins inflecting higher for the remainder of the year given easing commodity costs and better leverage, c) cap allocation enables 2-4% share reduction, and d) non iPhone hardware sales inflect higher and have better margins.

The declining share is despite our forecast for ~15% annual app store growth as we see newer services, primarily Apple Music and Apple Pay, increasing their revenue share. We are forecasting 2-year CAGRs of ~25% and ~50% for Apple Music and Pay, respectively. Less reliance on App Store revenue could help de-risk services as investors remain concerned about the future of the App Store as legal challenges mount. ï®    Services Valuation: We think there is potential for upside to AAPLâ€™s current valuation if the company were to continue to increase its mix of higher margin, less cyclical Services revenue over time.

Acceleration in Services Growth: AAPL saw its Services revenue trajectory meaningfully accelerate during FY16, which marked the same period as the iPhone 6S and the original launch of the Apple Upgrade Program which includes AppleCare+ (AppleCare revenue recognized in Services segment). Apple noted that y/y growth in Services was driven by the App Store, licensing (Samsung patent infringement lawsuit), and AppleCare sales in FY16. Services growth continued to accelerate in FY17 with Apple noting it had over 270m paid subscribers across all services (+100m vs FY16). Despite challenges with gaming approval in China, Apple noted China services revenue hit an all-time high in FY18 contributing to 24% Y/Y growth in the services segment.

In our view, iPhone price cuts, greater usage of financing vehicles, lower VAT taxes and Chinese consumer confidence that is up ~10 points from last summer (per the National Bureau of Statistics of China) are contributing to surprisingly stable demand trends. Supply chain data points also stable ahead of Sept 2019 iPhone launch. In addition to China installed base share gains that are stable QTD, iPhone supplier data points through May also paint a picture of limited downside, as evidenced by a cohort of 53 publicly traded Taiwan-based Apple supply chain companies posting above seasonal revenue growth for the last 3 months (Exhibit 2).

As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a is a positive relationship (although not enough data points to be technically           conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of statistically significant) between a Q/Q acceleration in supply chain sales (i.e. Y/Y   Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making growth in the June quarter accelerating from Y/Y growth in the March quarter)           their investment decision. and Apple issuing guidance ahead of consensus for the upcoming quarter (in this         For analyst certification and other important disclosures, refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this case, the September quarter). Quarter-to-date sales for this group of supply            report. 3831 chain names are up 5.3% Y/Y, a roughly 780bps acceleration from 2.5% Y/Y revenue declines in the first two months of the March quarter, which according to our regression model, would suggest September quarter sales guidance roughly in-line with current consensus of $61.3B (Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4). We'd also highlight that our Greater China Technology Hardware analyst Sharon Shih kept new model builds unchanged this month (while slightly lowering legacy builds due to recent iOS upgrades that improve performance on installed iPhones), which gives us confidence that iPhone demand, while weak (we forecast June quarter iPhone shipments down 10% Y/Y and Sept down 8% Y/Y), is not worsening materially due to broader geopolitical issues. What to do with Apple shares at these levels. Apple shares currently trade at 15x our CY20 EPS of $13.30, a turn lower than Apple's 2-year average trailing P/E of 16.1x, and ~2 turns lower than our price target of $231 implies. This suggests that trade and regulation remain overhangs that are partially priced into shares today (see our most recent views on trade and regulation), with trade the more near term risk. While President Trump's announcement that he plans for an ""extended"" meeting with Chinese President Xi at next week's G20 meetings is a positive development, the possibility remains that the US will place tariffs on the remaining $300B of imports from China, which assuming Apple doesn't receive an exception, would reverberate throughout the supply chain and lead to higher prices for consumers and higher costs for Apple. While the overhang of trade risk may keep shares range bound near-term, we see two important upcoming fundamental catalysts that should drive shares toward our price target, including 1) a potential acceleration in Services revenue growth as comps ease and new services ramp, and 2) Apple's 2020 launch of a 5G iPhone, which is typically priced into shares starting 6-9 months ahead of the launch date (which we see as September 2020; Exhibit 5). Importantly, the iPhone replacement cycle is already approaching four years, near where PC replacement rates stabilized, suggesting the product is at a structural ceiling where growth trends should stabilize long- term.

We are now trimming our calendar year 2019 shipment estimates to 183 mn vs. 185 mn prior, although marked by a much more significant reduction in our CQ2-CQ4 estimates to 139.5 mn relative to 144 mn earlier (-4% annualized reduction). Looking to the out-years, we continue to forecast a return to shipment growth in C2020/C2021. We now forecast 185 mn units in C2020 followed by 188 mn units in C2021, relative to 189 mn units in C2020 and 190 mn units in C2021 prior.

Morgan estimates. Growth forecast for C2020/C2021 driven by greater spec upgrades Given the significant decline expected in iPhone shipments in C2019, we believe investor expectations are primed for continued modest decline for both the smartphone industry and iPhone shipments in the out-years. However, we believe there is an opportunity for a modest acceleration in the replacement cycle driving a return to growth for iPhone shipments in C2020/C2021, led by the significant spec upgrades expected in the September 2020 launch. Based on our discussions with Qualcomm and interpretations relative to their recent settlement with Apple, we believe all three new iPhone models to be launched in 2020 will include 5G baseband modems with support for mmWave frequencies. Additionally, discussions with 3D Sensing companies indicates a strong likelihood of adoption of world facing 3D Sensing on the iPhone models to be launched in September 2020, driving industry leading AR/VR capabilities which can be leveraged by applications (including games) custom built for the platform. Challenges in China are concerning, but Apple is not new to navigating them We are aware that iPhone demand in China is on top of investor minds given the backdrop of continued uncertainty in the US and China trade relationship, which is impacting regional macro trends and consumer spending. However, it is important to keep in mind that challenges for iPhone sales in the China market are not new and we have been witnessing declines for the last few years. As shown in Figure 2 below, iPhone shipments to China have declined -6% in 2016, -2% in 2017, and -18% in 2018 driving the total iPhone shipments in China to a meagre 40 mn or 19% of total. 3 400"

Source: Company Reports, Evercore ISI Research 2 429 June 11, 2019 Downside Risk from Developers Negotiating Lower Fees Pending litigation and developer frustration are likely the greatest threats to Apple Services growth.

In our view, the first outcome is unlikely as the majority of the highest grossing apps on the App Store are gaming apps. These apps rely on one-time, in-game purchases as opposed to a subscription model like Netflix.

We estimate the App Store contributed ~$1.50 to FY18 EPS (~13%). In our worst case scenario, we assume the App Store Developer Payout is increased from 70% to 95%, which could drive a ~11% decline in EPS. If the payout was increased to ~75%, we estimate EPS could fall by ~2%.

Using Sensor Tower data, we estimate Apple earned ~$21m from Spotify subscribers in 2018 (<0.2% of 2018 App Store revenue). The $21m in 2018 revenue is down from ~$88.4m in 2016, despite overall App Store revenue growing by ~60%.

Divesting Music would leave Apple with a less complete services ecosystem, but we estimate it could bring in $15-$20B. If Apple is forced to sell Apple Music, we assume Spotify would be the mostly widely used comp. Spotify currently trades at ~3.9x revenue or 263x paid subscribers. Applying those multiples to our FY18 Apple music estimates of ~$5.1bn and 54m subscribers would value Apple Music at $15-$20bn.

As AAPLâ€™s Services revenue mix increases, we think the company could begin to provide more details surrounding user metrics (management indicated that ARPU increasing double-digits). Acceleration in Services Growth: AAPL saw its Services revenue trajectory meaningfully accelerate during FY16, which marked the same period as the iPhone 6S and the original launch of the Apple Upgrade Program which includes AppleCare+ (AppleCare revenue recognized in Services segment). Apple noted that y/y growth in Services was driven by the App Store, licensing (Samsung patent infringement lawsuit), and AppleCare sales in FY16. Services growth continued to accelerate in FY17 with Apple noting it had over 270m paid subscribers across all services (+100m vs FY16). Despite challenges with gaming approval in China, Apple noted China services revenue hit an all-time high in FY18 contributing to 24% Y/Y growth in the services segment. 4 431"

While the proposal didnâ€™t reference Apple specifically, in answering a question at SXSW in Austin Senator Warren implied Apple shouldnâ€™t be allowed to both run an app store platform and offer its own products on the platform (she was quoted as saying, ""Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They donâ€™t get to do both at the same time.â€). These three data points suggest an Apple-related antitrust investigation would most likely center on the App Store. Potential implications: Bear case valuation impact of $3-13. At issue in the EU investigation is Appleâ€™s preferential treatment of its own apps, specifically Apple Music, but also likely extending to yet-to-be-launched Apple TV+ and possibly          Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with Apple News. We estimate that Apple Music will generate $6.2B in revenue in             companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a CY20, which at an EV/Sales multiple in-line with Spotify (2.2x EV/CY20 sales)          conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of implies a value per share of $3, or 2% of Apple's current share price, that would      Morgan Stanley Research.

Alternatively, Apple could take steps to level the playing field in the App Store related to positioning of 3rd party apps relative to Apple developed apps. For example, Apple could make more of its underlying device hardware and software technology available to developers or lower Appleâ€™s commission rate. While an extreme scenario given the value Apple brings to 3rd party developers (reminder: the App Store generates 10x per device as the Google Play Store; For more on this topic, see here), a potential 50% cut in Appleâ€™s take rate starting in CY20 would equate to lost revenue of $9.5B and $13/share lower valuation, assuming a higher 5.0x, EV/ CY20 Sales multiple (the average of 9 platform/services peers) due to premium margins relative to Appleâ€™s media business (Exhibit 1). While we base our analysis on the potential impact to CY20, an antitrust lawsuit would likely take years to resolve, pushing the impact on Apple's business into future years. For instance, the FTC case against Qualcomm was filed in January 2017 with a ruling announced in May 2019. Near-term view on AAPL shares. We continue to see fundamental catalysts for AAPL shares over the next 3-9 months, including 1) iPhone replacement cycles are peaking ahead of 5G iPhone launch in Sept. 2020, which shares tend to price in 6-9 months prior to launch, and 2) easier App Store compares and new services launches re-accelerating Services growth, which are both reflected in our sum-of-the-parts base case valuation of $231. Our lowered bear case valuation of $147 (down from $156) now fully reflects the potential impact from trade and regulatory risks (Exhibit 2). Investor feedback suggests the market is looking for clarity around trade and regulatory risks such that shares could be range-bound between our bear and base case valuation in the very near-term. However, given a reasonable probability of outcomes on both trade and regulation that are better than our bear case analysis, we are buyers on any incremental weakness with the stock currently trading closer to our bear than base case valuation. Exhibit 1: We estimate that if Apple is forced to either divest their Apple Music/Media businesses or lower App Store take rates to combat recent antitrust claims, the result would be a $3-13 per share valuation impact.

App Store trending ahead of our June quarter estimate through end of May. While Apple didn't disclose total cumulative payments to developers for the first time in 3 years, recently released third party data on App Store trends show that Apple is outperforming our forecast QTD through May. Through May, we estimate that Apple generated ~$2.6B in App Store net revenue, up 18.9% Y/Y (Exhibit 1), a 380bps acceleration from March quarter App Store growth of 15.1% Y/Y, and trending above our 17% Y/Y growth forecast for the June quarter. For Apple to beat our estimate, the App Store needs to generate over $1,259M in net revenue during the month of June, which equates to 13.3% Y/Y growth and              Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with implies a fairly significant slowdown from growth over the last 3 months (Exhibit    companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

For analyst certification and other important disclosures, A few new details into Apple's upcoming Services launches. The WWDC keynote          refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this largely focused on new software updates but Apple also provided a few                report. 6771 incremental details on already announced by yet-to-be-launched Services. For example, Apple announced that Apple Arcade, Apple's upcoming subscription gaming service with access to over 100 new games, will be accessible via the newly redesigned Apple TV app, and that Apple will extend support to the Xbox One S and Playstation Dual Shock 4 controllers, suggesting robust gameplay and an easy transition for users previously tied to the Xbox or Playstation console. Apple also announced the end of iTunes, in favor of three standalone apps, Apple Music (which is being updated), Apple Podcasts (a new app), and Apple TV, which is being updated to host Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Apple Arcade and (on a Mac) Apple Music. While recent declines in the a la carte iTunes service likely precipitated this move, it also shows Apple's desire quickly shift its user base to Apple Music and Apple TV. Lastly, Tim Cook opened WWDC showing a trailer for Ron Moore's (Battlestar Galactica's creator) upcoming series For All Mankind, which will eventually be available through an Apple TV+ subscription. Several new iOS upgrades with a focus on privacy. One of the characteristics we have long written about as a differentiating factor for Apple is its ability to vertically integrate hardware and software, which few, if any, mobile competitors can replicate. Today, CEO Tim Cook highlighted that 85% of current iOS customers are running the latest version of iOS 12 vs. just 10% adoption for the latest Android operating system, Pie. This means that roughly 90% of the Android user base cannot access the latest software features on their mobile device, putting those users at a meaningful disadvantage vs. Apple users in terms of user experience. Packaged with Apple's latest iOS update (iOS 13), users get several new features, such as Dark Mode, live radio, full voice control, a standalone Siri Shortcuts app and updated smart lists and reminder apps, updated Memoji support for iPhone 6s and newer, a combined ""Find My"" app that works even with devices that are asleep, and a completely redesigned and updated Apple Maps, not to mention 30% faster unlocking with FaceID and 2x the launch speed for opening apps. Additionally, Apple emphasized privacy standards by introducing features such as the ""Sign in with Apple"" button, which will serve as an alternative to sign-in buttons from other platforms, like Facebook and Google, where data privacy standards aren't as high as Apple's. iOS 13 also allows users to choose when to share their name and email address with the option to provide a unique random email address to third parties. iOS 13 will also help users better understand and limit location tracking while updates to HomeKit encrypt video stored in the cloud (for free). Deepening device features and products to attract more commercial users. Apple introduced new features that make iPad more appealing as a productivity device. For example, Apple introduced the first ever iPadOS, which contains all of the updates from iOS 13 in addition to new features only accessible on the iPad, such as Split View and Slide Over for native and third party apps to improve multi-tasking capabilities, an updated Files app that supports iCloud drive folder sharing and access to external drives, desktop class browsing in Safari with 30 new keyboard shortcuts, enhanced capabilities (and latency) with the Apple Pencil, as well as (bluetooth and/or USB) mouse support. Apple also introduced the new Mac Pro, a $11k+ machine (including the display) targeted at high-end commercial and design use cases, which contains an Intel Xeon Processor with up to 28 cores, up to 1.5TB of system memory, access to 8 internal PCI slides, support for 2 Radeon Pro Vega II GPUs and the ability to play 3 concurrent 8k 6782"

For reference, we model 37M iPhone shipments in the June quarter (- 10% Y/Y), in-line with iPhone builds, which implies a 5th consecutive quarter of double digit iPhone shipment declines in China. If we assume Chinese demand significantly weakens in the last 6 weeks of the quarter and iPhone shipments instead fall 50% Y/Y (a 10 point further deceleration from March Q declines),       Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with then we'd expect 2.3M lower iPhone units (-6% vs. our current model), $1.6B         companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a lower revenue (-2.9%) and a $0.05 hit to EPS (-2.3%), all else equal.               conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Can Apple gain smartphone share on the back of the Huawei blacklist? After          Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making placing Huawei on a US export blacklist on May 17th, the US Department of           their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, Commerce eased restrictions last week, giving suppliers a 90-day reprieve           refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this (through August 19th) to service existing Huawei networks and smartphones,          report. 15 1 although a ban on delivering components for new products without an exemption/license remains in place. Also last week, Digitimes reported that Huawei has already built 6-12 months worth of component inventory and can support shipments through 2019 year end, so the smartphone playing field is unlikely to meaningfully change in the near-term. And in the event a trade deal is finalized, we'd expect the export ban on Huawei to ease significantly. Outside of China, which accounted for 60% of Huawei's T12M premium smartphone shipments ($400+) and where we expect consumers to remain loyal Huawei customers, we believe the most significant opportunity for Apple to take share from Huawei is in EMEA and LatAm, where Huawei has 16% and 13% of premium smartphone shipment share (equivalent to 15M+ devices), respectively (Exhibit 2). It was reported last week that two wireless carriers in the UK (EE and Vodafone) already decided to remove Huawei's Mate 20X smartphone from their 5G launch, suggesting that small share gains may be possible in the near term. However, we'd point out that Samsung has 29% and 33% market share in EMEA and Latam, respectively, making them the #1 Android-based smartphone vendor in each region and a more reasonable alternative to Huawei. Therefore, we don't believe Apple can make sizable share gains at Huawei's expense in the near term, although the situation remains fluid and more carriers removing Huawei devices from their offerings would make us more bullish on this opportunity. Can Apple obtain an exclusion from the proposed final round of tariffs on US imports from China? On May 10th, the Office of the US Trade Representation proposed additional tariffs (25%) on the remaining ~$300B of goods imported from China, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Over the course of the next month (final comments are due June 24th and a final list can be released thereafter), the proposal will go through a public comment process at which time companies can suggest certain product headings be eliminated from the final list of taxed goods. While our strategists and economists don't have these tariffs becoming policy in their base case, they believe the risk of implementation continues to rise (for more on the big picture timeline and process for tariff implementation, see here: US Public Policy, Economics, and Rates Strategy: US- China Trade: FAQs on the Possible Next Escalation). Assuming the timeline outlined by the USTR remains unchanged, Apple has roughly one month to propose removing certain product categories before the list of tariffed goods is finalized. It's important to note that Apple (and others) successfully argued their case in September 2018, when the USTR removed devices that receive and transmit voice data (which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods) from the final list of the $200B tranche of goods that saw a tariff go into effect before year end. In the event Apple is unsuccessful in persuading the USTR to remove key categories from the final list of taxed goods, Apple's representative will have to submit a request for each particular product they'd like to be excluded, and provide a rationale as to why it should be excluded from the tariff list. Assuming this is the case, Apple will likely argue that iOS users have no alternative to Apple products (i.e. to switch to an Android based smartphone or other technology product would do harm to the US consumer) and that almost all of Apple's R&D is done in the US. While conceivable, it's unclear how the USTR would view these arguments. And while the USTR has granted 125 exclusions thus far, they only apply to the first $34B round of tariffs announced in mid-2018. The exclusion process for the $200B List 3 of imported 16 2 goods has not begun yet and the process for the final round of $300B won't start until List 3 is finalized and the details for the exclusion process are announced. Nevertheless, if granted, exclusions would be retroactive to the start date of the tariffs. For more on the potential impact (and other mitigating factors) from the final round of tariffs on Apple, please see our latest views here: Tech Hardware Pulse: What Investors Are Asking: An Update on the AAPL Tariff Risk (9 May 2019) Is there a possibility that the Chinese government would retaliate by including the iPhone in tariffs the Chinese government places on US imports? On May 13th, it was reported that China would be raising tariffs on $60B worth of US imports, including ""other telephones using cellular network or wifi"". We don't see this as a meaningful risk because tariffs are levied at the port where products enter the country, and iPhones are currently produced within Chinese borders. More likely in our view is that the government could place an informal ban on purchasing certain products as it has done in the past for parts of the market (such as for government officials several years ago), which could have a negative impact on iPhone demand. Even in the absence of a formal, government issued ban, consumers may continue to protest the trade conflict by purchasing domestic branded smartphones at the expense of iPhone. What does this all mean? How do you think about bear case EPS and the near term floor for the stock? After peaking at $210 in early May, Apple shares have retreated back to the $180 range following the escalation of US/China trade rhetoric. The situation remains extremely fluid and we admit that quantifying the overall impact of geopolitical tensions on Apple is difficult given the unknowns around timing, demand impact, retaliatory measures, exclusions, etc. Near term, the greatest risk to Apple is that Chinese consumers meaningfully slow their purchases of Apple products, which would likely cause another round of estimate cuts, similar to the scenario we framed above. In the event the US places a 25% tax on all Chinese imports to the US (with no exclusions provided), and that becomes the status quo, we see 19-23% downside to FY20 EPS, and frame two scenarios in Exhibit 3 below. First, the worst case scenario where Apple absorbs all tariff costs and chooses not to pass pricing onto consumers, we'd expect our current FY20 EPS of $12.67 to fall by ~23% to $9.72. More realistic however, is that Apple will share in the incremental tariff cost with consumers (i.e. hike prices) and component suppliers or engage in other mitigation efforts, while also seeing softer US demand due to higher device prices. In this scenario, we estimate that Apple would raise the price of US devices (iPhones, iPads, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods) by roughly 15% (Exhibit 4). As you can see in Exhibit 5 we estimate this would have a material impact on unit demand and product gross margins in the US, but that higher ASPs (from US price increases) would act as a partial offset, although we also assume the higher pricing causes US consumers to mix down to more legacy devices. Additionally, we assume Apple's Chinese device sales take a material hit as consumers switch to local Chinese brands. Net we estimate this would result in a 10% hit to our current FY20 revenue, a 110bps hit to gross margins, a 200bps hit to operating margins, and a 19% hit to FY20 EPS (assuming Apple also slows buybacks to $10B/quarter, lower than our current $20B/quarter estimate). In this scenario, we'd expect Apple's business outside of China and US to remain relatively 17 3"

Assuming roughly a quarter of iPhone shipments are imported into the US following assembly in China, we estimate absorbing the cost of the tariff would imply that gross margins on total iPhone revenues decline by 4%. Assuming similar headwinds on other hardware products, including Mac devices, iPad, wearables, and accessories, imply to us an aggregate -14% EPS downside to our base case earnings assumption (see details starting page 3).

Relative to Apple, the products that will be impacted by the $200 bn tariff primarily include those from the â€œOther Productsâ€ segment, which has total revenues of approximately $8 bn in FY19E, excluding Apple Watch, which we believe accounts for more than half of the segment revenues, with the remaining products having lower gross margins around 20%. iPhones, iPads, iMacs and Apple Watches are not included in the tariff. We see limited impact as Apple is likely to take pricing to offset the pressures We believe it is relatively easier for Apple to raise prices on the accessories than to take price increases on the iPhone. We expect relatively minimal price elasticity for accessory products and expect Apple to likely raise prices to cover entirely for the tariffs. As shown in Table 1 below, we expect the 25% tariff to translate into a price increase if Apple decides to pass the entire impact of the tariff to consumers.

Following a +27% rise in AAPL shares YTD, although not materially different from the +25% rise on average for our coverage universe, our conversations with investors heading into the print indicated hesitation in building incremental positions led by expectations of continued downside risk around iPhone volumes. However, with F3Q guidance indicating that Apple is balancing price and volume to maximize the revenue opportunity and is likely to get back to y/y revenue growth following only two quarters of y/y declines, we expect significant improvement in investor sentiment. Additionally, investors will look at the combination of a $75 bn share buyback program and a growing dividend, supported by strong free cash flow, as providing solid support to the stock, driving incremental positions from investors otherwise underinvested in the stock relative to their benchmarks.

Apple reported a clean March quarter and bullish June quarter outlook which against a backdrop of negative investor sentiment sets up for shares to move higher. We address key surprises and debates coming out of the print: (+) March strength carried into the June quarter. We recently highlighted growing iPhone market share of active smartphones in China, with the largest Y/Y increase in 15 months during the month of March (Exhibit 2). Additionally, we were positive into earnings on the back of stable supply chain builds which Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with tracked ahead of our model for most of the quarter, and iPhone replacement          companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a rates that are approaching levels of the more mature PC market, which we view       result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of as a ceiling given the higher engagement, wear and tear, and battery dependency     Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider of smartphones. What we learned tonight is that improved iPhone trends              Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their investment decision. continued into April with improving consumer confidence and further China           For analyst certification and other important disclosures, stimulus in the form of lower VAT tax rates. The company also saw iPhone            refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this report. demand trends improve outside of China, partially a result of promoting the 1091 higher residual value of iPhones through trade-in programs. While iPhone is the biggest driver of better June quarter guidance, higher mix of Services and Wearables, which don't exhibit as much seasonality, also contribute to a stronger than normal June quarter outlook. (=) Lower memory prices not flowing through to higher margins. Despite a ~40% reduction in spot flash prices over the past year and higher services mix, gross margin fell 70bps Y/Y with a similar drop expected in the June quarter. The biggest offset to lower memory prices is the stronger US dollar, which alone is a 140bps Y/Y headwind in June. Recent rollback of currency moves in the form of price cuts along with more aggressive trade-in promotions (trade-in value is now slightly higher than street value in some cases) are smaller headwinds to margins. On a sequential basis, Apple also faces a mix headwind in Services after the seasonal boost in China App Store sales around Chinese New Year. While Qualcomm settlement terms weren't disclosed, the fact that Apple guided to a similar margin range as three months ago suggests any impact of the settlement is insignificant, especially when netted against other declining component costs. (+) Services metrics continue to support our view that investors underappreciate this business. Services accounted for 20% of revenue and 33% of gross profit dollars in the March quarter, with revenue growing 16% Y/Y, in- line with consensus despite softness in China gaming and weaker Google mobile TAC. Apple saw double digit growth in almost every service including App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, AppleCare, Apple Pay and App Store Search Ads (+70% Y/Y). Most importantly, 3rd party paid subscriptions on the App Store grew 40% Y/Y in every region, highlighting the attractiveness of iOS users who are more engaged with their smartphones and spend 10x Android users on their respective app store platform. Exhibit 1: Our new SoTP price target of $240 (up from $234 prior) is driven by a slightly higher CY19 revenue forecast and Services peer multiple expansion.

Looking back, iCloud and Apple Music contributed roughly 300bps, on average, to Services revenue growth in their first full year post launch. We also see Y/Y compares for App Store revenue improving beginning in the June quarter as the industry annualizes last year's pause in gaming license approvals in China. Second, iPhone can become a contributor to multiple expansion again. We estimate iPhone replacement cycles lengthened to >3 years in the December quarter, and will hit ~4 years by fiscal year end, relatively on par with the mature PC market, which reflects a ceiling, in our view (Exhibit 1). Plus, iPhone data points stabilized early in the March quarter with a positive inflection in China active installed base share and Taiwan supplier monthly sales improving at March quarter end (Exhibit 2). Additionally, the recent Qualcomm settlement increases the likelihood of a 5G iPhone launch in 2020, which the stock typically starts           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with pricing in 6-9 months early (Exhibit 3).                                                 companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a Lastly, our conversations with institutional investors suggest most are                  conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider uninvolved or underweight/short despite the likelihood of Services growth re-            Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making accelerating, iPhone declines moderating, and continued share price support from         their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, the company buying back stock (Exhibit 4). We see these catalysts helping re-rate        refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this shares towards our updated sum-of-the-parts price target of $234 (vs. $220               report. 1641 prior), which increases due to recent Services peer multiple expansion (from 6.3x to 7.0x; Exhibit 5). Our new price target implies Apple trades at 20.3x CY19 P/E or 17.4x CY20 P/E, compared to AAPL's two-year average forward P/E of 16.1x, with the premium reflecting the fact that Services accounts for roughly 35% of gross profit dollars in FY19 compared to just 12% 4 years ago. Expect March Q results towards the high end of management's guidance range... We continue to believe that Apple will report March quarter revenue at the high end of management's $55-59B guidance range after F2Q iPhone activation data in China showed improving market share in January that continued into February and March (see details here and here) but wasn't fully baked into management's revenue guidance (Exhibit 6). We flow this demand uptick through our model and now forecast 42M iPhone shipments in the March quarter (-20% Y/Y), up from 40M prior, which is in-line with March quarter iPhone builds from our Asia colleagues and above buy-side expectations of 38-40M units. This is partially offset by lower March Q iPhone ASPs of $724 (from $755, and vs. consensus at $748), which accounts for a greater mix of legacy products and iPhone price cuts in international markets. We also tweak our iPad ASP estimates higher to account for stronger than expected product mix, and lower our Services forecast to $11.4B (+16% Y/Y), which now takes into account the 1 point deceleration in March quarter App Store revenue we highlighted in early April. Net, we now model March quarter revenue of $58.2B (up from $57.7B prior), 1.4% higher than consensus at $57.4B, a gross margin of 37.7% (in-line with consensus of 37.7%), and EPS of $2.40 (vs. consensus of $2.36; Exhibit 7). ...and June guidance largely in-line with historical seasonality. Historically, Apple has approached June quarter guidance with conservatism, guiding below street revenue estimates by 3% on average or 2% at the median over the last 5 years (Exhibit 8), suggesting a $50-52B revenue guide. Our bottom-up analysis of June quarter trends implies the upper end of this range, or $52B (-2% Y/Y), driven by our unchanged 35M iPhone shipment estimate, 2% iPhone ASP declines (lower than +3% previously to account for the potential for more discounting), and 17% Y/Y Services growth. On gross margins, we believe Apple's June quarter gross margin guidance could surprise to the upside, upticking from March quarter guidance due to work down of memory inventory and lower memory spot prices. For example, if we make an assumption that spot memory prices over the last month represents a more accurate profile of Apple's cost as compared to pricing 12 months ago, it implies a ~160bps tailwind to iPhone margins in the June quarter, all else equal. Given these dynamics, we expect June quarter gross margin guidance of 37.5-38.5%, or 50bps higher than March Q guidance. We currently model June quarter gross margin and EPS of 38.1% and $2.06, respectively (vs. consensus at 38.0% and $2.08). Expect Apple to announce a 10% dividend raise and at least a $50B increase to buyback authorization. Following the passage of tax reform at the end of 2017, Apple took a more aggressive stance to capital allocation by announcing plans to become net cash neutral ""over time"", which subsequently led to a 16% annual dividend raise (vs. historical 10% Y/Y raise) and $100B increase in buyback authorization 12 months ago. We expect Apple to remain aggressive on the capital allocation front and forecast a 10% dividend increase, to $0.80/quarter/share and an increase to Apple's buyback authorization of at least $50B. This would bring Apple's total buyback authorization under the plan 1652 announced a year ago to at least $150B, of which roughly $95-100B will be remaining following the March quarter, we estimate. We continue to forecast Apple repurchasing $15-20B in shares each quarter through FY21, which will reduce total diluted shares outstanding by mid-to-high single digit percent annually and add more than $1.00 to EPS in FY20. 1663"

China installed base share gains accelerate to fastest rate in 15 months. According to data from Jiguang, a firm that aggregates smartphone data from its push-messaging services in China, Apple's share of the Chinese smartphone installed base grew ~300bps Y/Y in March, greater than any other smartphone brand in China, and the largest Y/Y increase for the iPhone in the last 15 months (Exhibit 1). This marks the third consecutive month of Y/Y share gains in China, a noticeable reversal from December quarter performance, where Apple lost share for three consecutive months. Similarly, Apple was the only top 3 smartphone vendor in China to gain installed base share M/M in March, a reversal from March 2018, when Apple lost share while most other smartphone brands in China gained share (Exhibit 2). As of March quarter-end, Apple had 20.9% smartphone installed base share in China, closing the gap for #1 market share vs.    Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a Huawei by 190bps M/M (Exhibit 3).                                                    result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Three other important (recent) data points supporting our positively biased          Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making view. Following our note in mid-March, there have been three other data points       their investment decision. we believe support our positively biased view on iPhone shipments into the           For analyst certification and other important disclosures, quarter.

Second, March marked the second consecutive month that our Asia team kept iPhone builds stable, suggesting a run-rate improvement from the December quarter. Importantly, Apple March quarter revenue and EPS guidance didn't consider the demand uptick in January continuing into February and March which now appears much more likely, suggesting the company could report at the high end of March quarter guidance. Finally, March monthly sales from a cohort of 53 Taiwanese component suppliers were largely better than expected, growing 2% Y/Y, or 35% M/M, 15 points higher than trailing two-year seasonality (albeit off an easy comp), suggesting recent iPhone trends could sustain beyond March (Exhibit 5). Our March quarter iPhone estimate remains unchanged at 40M units (-23% Y/Y), which is slightly below consensus of 42.8M units (-18% Y/Y) but above buy- side expectations of 38-40M, and 5% below our Asia team's March quarter iPhone builds of 42M units. 1922 Analysis Exhibit 1: We are positively biased into the March quarter as iPhone share gains have inflected positively in China over the last 3 months following iPhone price cuts that started in January 2019. iPhone Y/Y China Installed Base Share Change (Bps) 350                                                                                                                                      298 300 250 200                                                                                                                    165 150                                                                                                                             134 100                                                              74 50                                                                           32 - (50)                              (26) (100)                   (56) (150)                                       (109) (83)                            (93) (80) (85) (131) (200) Nov-18 May-18 Jul-18 Oct-18 Apr-18 Dec-18 Mar-18 Jun-18 Sep-18 Jan-19 Feb-19 Mar-19 Aug-18 Source: AlphaWise, Morgan Stanley Research; Jiguang Exhibit 2: Apple posted M/M share gains in March 2019, while the majority of other smartphone brands posted declines, bucking the trend from March 2018.

Below we present our 4 key takeaways from the March quarter App Store data. (+) On a directional basis, the growth slowdown was in-line with our expectations and doesn't change our Services thesis. On pre-revised App Store results, we forecasted a 1 point growth deceleration in the March quarter, from 18% Y/Y in C4Q18, to 17% Y/Y in C1Q19. While the absolute rate of March quarter net revenue growth was lower at 15% Y/Y (due to Sensor Tower's revision of historical data), the 1 point deceleration from December quarter growth of 16% Y/Y directionally aligns with the 1 point March quarter slowdown we expected. Importantly, consensus currently forecasts a 3 point deceleration in March            Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with quarter Services revenue, from 19% Y/Y growth in the December quarter, to 16%         companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a Y/Y growth in March, suggesting a 1 point deceleration in App Store revenue was       conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of likely better than feared. As a result, we don't believe the market should            Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making interpret this data point as a surprise.                                              their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, (+) For a second consecutive quarter, gaming growth accelerated, due in large         refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this part to China. Given gaming represents 70% of T12M App Store net revenue, the         report. 2811 acceleration from 9% Y/Y gaming revenue growth in December to 10% Y/Y growth in the March quarter should be interpreted positively (Exhibit 4). In China, which represents roughly â…“ of total App Store gaming revenue, gaming growth inflected to +2% Y/Y from 1% declines in the December quarter. We believe that the December quarter will mark a trough for China gaming revenue growth and that growth will accelerate from the March quarter for two main reasons. First, the March quarter faced tough Y/Y comps as Chinese authorities didn't halt new gaming license approvals until March 2018, and have taken a more conservative approach to new license approvals this year. So while 959 new licenses have been approved YTD, that meaningfully trails gaming license approvals during the same period last year. Going forward however, the Y/Y gaming comps ease significantly (Exhibit 5) since nearly zero new gaming licenses were approved in the March-December 2018 period. Second, Chinese authorities just approved the first batch of 30 imported gaming licenses following a one-year suspension, with key gaming titles like Fortnite, Call of Duty Mobile and PUBG in line for approval. While the timing of these approvals is unknown, the combination of easing comps and accelerating license approvals gives us confidence China gaming revenue growth will accelerate from here, helping offset any potential slowdown in other regions. (-) Downloads growth is slowing but is being offset by growing spend per download. For the first time since at least 1Q15 (as far back as we have the data), the number of quarterly downloads declined, falling 5% Y/Y. However, net revenue per download, a gauge of consumer spend per download, increased 21% Y/Y, an acceleration from 14% Y/Y growth in the December quarter (Exhibit 6). While the decline in downloads is something investors should monitor, it's not necessarily indicative of consumer app usage trends, since App Store net revenue is correlated more so with spend per download (driven by in-app purchases) rather than the absolute level of downloads. And the acceleration in spend per download growth this quarter shows us that app engagement remains healthy. (-) Entertainment is a category to keep our eye on after a significant deceleration. Entertainment (which does not include music) is the second largest App Store category, representing ~7% of T12M App Store revenue. And while it's dwarfed by the gaming category, Entertainment has been a source of strong/emerging growth - in the last 4 years, quarterly growth averaged 104% Y/Y. In the December quarter, Entertainment net revenue growth decelerated to 39% Y/Y, from 76% Y/Y in the quarter prior. And in the March quarter, growth decelerated again to 26% Y/Y (Exhibit 7). The deceleration could be a direct result of the actions taken by some large entertainment companies that no longer support Apple's payment platform as a method of payment for new subscribers. Netflix, for example, was the App Store's top grossing app in 2018, so the loss of revenue from new subscriber growth on the NFLX platform is a headwind. Nevertheless, the impact is still relatively small - if we were to assume March quarter Entertainment net revenue growth remained constant at the December quarter growth rate of 39% Y/Y, that would imply an extra $33M in March quarter revenue, or 0.09% of total App Store net revenue. 2822 Analysis Exhibit 1: App Store net revenue was $3.7B in the March quarter, up 15% Y/Y, a 1 point deceleration from December quarter growth of 16% Y/Y.

However, on the positive                  (1-212) 622-9036 side, while there were limited expectations for announcements beyond video, Apple                       joseph.cardoso@jpmchase.com J.P.

Additionally, although Apple indicated it would disclose pricing for the TV+ video subscription later, we believe Apple might be challenged in monetizing its own original content with users, given its limited scope relative to large content providers like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO. Continuing on the recent strategic direction of offering Apple Services on non-iOS platforms, Apple will be making the TV+ video subscription on Samsung smart TVs as well as on Amazon Fire TV, LG, Roku, Sony platforms in the future.

Apple announced Apple News+, a new subscription service that will give users access to content from 300 popular magazines, several newspapers and digital publications through one application. Key partnerships announced include, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and Toronto Star, and several magazines including Vogue, National Geographic Magazine, People, ELLE, Bon AppÃ©tit, and ESPN. Apple News+ is available immediately at $9.99 (family sharing at no additional cost). The subscription will also be rolled out simultaneously in United States and Canada with availability in Australia and Europe starting later in 2019. While Apple may have been able to strike deals with several key partners, we believe the new subscription offers limited incremental functionalities to the Texture app, which already allowed customers to access content from 200 leading magazines. ï‚· Apple Card offers several customer benefits that might trigger significant adoption. Although already mentioned previously in press reports, the announcement yesterday surprised most relative to a credit card (Apple Card) launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs and MasterCard. Apple Card will be available both digitally in the wallet app (could be used at locations accepting Apple Pay) and in the form of a physical card, which could be used at locations not accepting Apple Pay (following on the lines of the Square Cash app and card). Apple will use on-device processing to allow users to track and manage transactions, as well as spending trends. The positives relative to the positioning of the card include absence of fees and differentiation of rewards through focus on daily cash backs. The introduction of Apple Card will allow the firm to leverage the growing adoption of Apple Pay and capture a greater portion of the fees in the payment ecosystem. The card is expected to be available to U.S customers starting in summer of 2019. ï‚· Gaming subscription although a surprise in terms of timing, makes strategic sense in leveraging strong growth expectations for mobile gaming. Apple introduced a gaming subscription service (closely following Googleâ€™s launch of Stadia), called Apple Arcade, which would include roughly 100 exclusive games. Unlike most of the games available currently on App Store, Apple is going to work with developers directly, including sharing development costs, to develop exclusive games for the platform. The strategic rationale of a gaming subscription is strong, given an estimated ~1 bn gaming customers already on the App Store, as well as now owning services that can leverage growth in mobile gaming (stronger growth expected than gaming industry overall). While Apple plans to roll out the service in fall of 2019, it didnâ€™t disclose the pricing details of the subscription yet. 2 330"

Chart 1 - FY19e Apple Services Revenue How much can they charge? Apple TV+ launches this fall with a small library of originals ($B) to compete against Netflix ($12.99/mo) and Disney+ Apple did not disclose the subscription cost, but it would likely be substantially below Netflix ($12.99) and Disney+ (TBA), formidable competition with deep libraries. Apple has reportedly spent over $1B on originals (vs $12B cash spend for NFLX) including expensive looking projects involving Steve Carell, JJ Abrams and Oprah. If Apple is playing the long game here, it could pressure financials for years.

But this is just a new way to package the same business Apple already does today, where it takes a 30% cut of subscription revs (15% yr 2) via the App Store. Apple News+ looks compelling This is a solid value prop for consumers, and looks profitable for Apple. We canceled our $32.99 / mo WSJ All Access subscription and replaced it with Apple News+ for $9.99, available now. Apple will takes a rev cut (50%?), like the App Store. If Apple Music has 50MM paid subs in 3 yrs on a global rollout, what can Apple News+ do in just the US and Canada? Probably far fewer.

As showcased by the firmâ€™s success with Apple Music, which was launched in 2015, roughly seven years after market leader Spotify (launched in 2008) and even more relative to other larger market players at that time, including Pandora (which launched in the year 2000), Appleâ€™s existing installed base of customers provides a relatively easier path to scale services opportunities. Despite the late entry into the market, Apple Music has steadily built towards 50 mn paid subscribers roughly four years after the launch, relative to Spotifyâ€™s 100 mn paid subscribers roughly 11 years after the launch, again representing a stronger ramp pace relative to other players, which we believe is largely driven by Appleâ€™s access to 900 mn iPhone users. ï‚· Expect a packaged media subscription from Apple to potentially further accelerate subscriptions and scale the service faster. As outlined in our initiation report last year (see report here), we expect Apple would be able to leverage its installed base better with a media subscription encompassing, Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple Video in the future. We expect the launch of a video service offering will drive synergies for iOS services, further accelerating growth in Apple Music subscribers as well as driving existing Apple Music subscribers to move into a more premium media service offering. 2 372"

This is on the back of QUARTERLY MODELWARE EPS ($) Apple cutting iPhone XR prices in January and retailers noting improved sales. 2019e         2019e        2020e         2020e Price cuts on XS and XS Max could improve demand further in the month of              Quarter          2018       Prior       Current        Prior       Current March where we don't yet have data.

Third, this is the first time that our March (and June) quarter iPhone     e = Morgan Stanley Research estimates, a = Actual Company reported data forecast is actually below our Asia Hardware team's build forecast (Exhibit 2), suggesting near term estimates may have overshot on the downside. While Apple acknowledged that January month sales improved from December, March quarter guidance didn't assume this improvement carried into February and March, while installed base trends suggest that may prove conservative. Fourth, based on our 180M FY19 iPhone shipment forecast, replacement cycles have converged with PCs after which we would expect stabilization. Our recent investor conversations point to neutral/negative positioning, providing a constructive set-up into the print which we expect in early May. Smartphone installed base and shipment data confirms Apple lost traction in China in 4Q18. While Apple maintained 9% share of Chinese smartphone shipments in 2018 (in-line with 9% in 2017), it lost 150bps of share in 4Q18 on the   Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a back of strong outperformance from Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, which collectively          result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a gained over 1200bps of shipment share in 4Q18 (Exhibit 3). That said, we view         conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider installed base share as the most credible gauge of share in China given               Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making differences in channel inventory build and replacement cycles that can influence      their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, shipment data. From an active installed base perspective, data from Jiguang, a        refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this firm that aggregates smartphone data from its push-messaging services in China,       report. 3921 analyzed in partnership with our AlphaWise team, also suggests Apple, while leading in overall installed base share, ceded share to Chinese brands each month in the December quarter (evident in Exhibit 1), coinciding with our weaker checks and reduced outlook back in December. Following early 2019 price cuts, the iPhone has inflected to Y/Y installed base share gains. Apple's weak C4Q iPhone results in China provided ammunition for bears to argue that Apple has lost its way in China. However, Apple Y/Y installed base share gains inflected positively in both January and February, which we believe is evidence that recent price cuts are positively stimulating demand, even in a weaker Chinese smartphone market. While it's still too early to extrapolate what this implies for March quarter iPhone shipments, recent price cuts on Apple's most popular new model in China, the XS Max (see next paragraph), combined with installed base share gains and stable iPhone builds are the most positive data points we have seen in months and makes us more confident that there is likely upside, rather than downside, to our March quarter iPhone unit estimates. And from a Services standpoint, iPhone's strong installed base share in China (Exhibit 4) increases confidence in Apple further monetizing a large, and growing user base. Contrary to expectations, the XS Max is the most popular new iPhone model with users in China. IDC data through December shows that Apple shipped 1.4M iPhone XS, 3.3M iPhone XS Max and 5.3M iPhone XR's in China in C2H18. However, active installed base data in China shows that user adoption of the iPhone XS Max is meaningfully higher than the iPhone XR, implying that while sell-in for the iPhone XR in China may have been strongest, sell-through disappointed, and sell-through for the XS Max has been healthier (Exhibit 5). This would align with our view that Chinese consumers still view the iPhone as an aspirational brand, and also helps explain why Apple (and channel partners) targeted pricing cuts on the XR earlier than the XS and XS Max. New AirPods disclosures from IDC highlight strong growth but also supply constraints. IDC recently updated their Wearables tracker to include ear-worn devices (i.e. AirPods), highlighting that AirPod trailing 12 month revenue and shipment growth was 58% and 60%, respectively. However, after shipments grew 87% Y/Y in F2Q-F4Q18, shipment growth slowed to 8% in the December quarter, as supply constraints impacted Apple's ability to get enough product to customers. A recent note from our Greater China Tech Hardware analysts points to expectations for AirPods production to double in 2019 to 45-50M units, from ~20M units in 2018, and we'd expect growth to reaccelerate on the back of an increase in AirPods supply. We now include a stand-alone AirPods forecast in our updated AAPL model and forecast shipment growth reaccelerating to 50% Y/Y in F2H19 (Exhibit 6). We continue to view the combination of Wearables and Services as key to Apple driving sustained long-term revenue and EPS growth while we model annual iPhone revenue declines of 4% over the next three years (Exhibit 7). 3932 Analysis Exhibit 1: We are positively biased into the March quarter as iPhone share gains have inflected positively in Chine over the last two months following iPhone price cuts that started in January 2019. iPhone Y/Y China Installed Base Share Change (Bps) 200                                                                                                                  165 150                                                                                                                            134 100                                                               74 50                                                                            32 - (50)                             (26) (56) (100)                                                     (83)                            (93) (80) (85) (109) (150)        (131) Apr-18 Oct-18 Nov-18 Dec-18 Mar-18 May-18 Jun-18 Jul-18 Aug-18 Sep-18 Jan-19 Feb-19 Source: AlphaWise, Morgan Stanley Research; Jiguang Exhibit 2: Additionally, our March quarter iPhone shipment estimate is currently lower than March quarter iPhone builds, despite the fact that builds typically exceed shipments in the March quarter, suggesting estimates have potentially overshot on the downside.

For now Services otherwise noted. growth is unlikely to offset iPhone unit declines, which should persist through 2019. Apple's push into streaming video is likely to happen soon. Following Apple's pre announcement on Jan. 2, the company has made clear that it plans on launching new services this year, one of which will likely be an OTT streaming service. Reports indicate that the offering will be a mix of both originally produced content and an aggregation of existing content from other streaming sources. We think the service will operate similarly to the App Store where Apple will take a 30% revenue cut. Video does reflect upside to our model; but would take 250MM subs to represent 5% of 2023 revs. In our Services Deep Dive report, we determined that Services could represent 30%+ of Apple's overall business by 2023, assuming no new Services offerings. While the streaming offering could help them reach that bogey, we are not yet convinced that streaming will meaningfully reaccelerate Services growth. If we assume that Apple charges $15 per month and takes a 30% cut from content producers, Apple would need to have 250m subscribers on its platform to represent just 5% of overall revenue by 2023. Net, we are not yet convinced that Streaming can cause an inflection in company level growth. Even with video, Services growth is not enough to offset iPhone unit declines, which should persist through 2019 and beyond. We remain cautious on iPhone demand, particularly in China, where upside looks limited this year. 2019 iPhones seem unlikely to offer compelling reasons to upgrade, and consumers may even postpone iPhone purchases until 5G. While we remain bullish on the long-term Services opportunity, it is too small to offset this material headwind for now.

Price Performance 240 ï‚· Video gaming stands out to us as a potential sector target given the combination of: 1) leverage to an industry rapidly transitioning to mobile; 2) hardware capabilities                      200 $ for high-end gaming potentially supporting a replacement cycle; 3) synergies in                           160 gaming services with iPhoneâ€™s hardware leadership, including in AR/VR; and 4) 120 access to installed gaming hardware of hundreds of millions of units, including both                            Feb-18     May-18   Aug-18   Nov-18    Feb-19 mobile and consoles. Among targets mentioned in press reports, we find Activision                                            AAPL share price ($) S&P500 (rebased) Blizzard to be the best strategic fit.

Among targets mentioned in press reports, we find Sonos to be the best strategic fit due to its differentiated position as a premium home speaker system relative to Amazon Alexa and Google Home, strong loyalty among current consumers, and robust international presence. ï‚· Video content is another possibility given the combination of: 1) leverage to rapid growth in content consumption on mobile; 2) an established platform to accelerate Appleâ€™s nascent investments in original content; and 3) opportunities for advertising revenues in the future, enhancing Apple's position as an aggregator of content. We find Netflix as the best strategic fit, although we appreciate a combination is less likely as Netflix is unlikely to be a seller for a modest premium. Apple Inc.

However, despite the success of the firm's Services strategy, the recently accelerating headwinds in the smartphone industry (and iPhones) are likely to drive a need for Apple to accelerate its Services offering and offset the smartphone-related headwinds in a more appreciable manner. Opportune time to use strong balance sheet to re-focus on Services theme In recent times, headwinds in the smartphone industry, including a challenging outlook for iPhone volumes in both calendar 2018 and 2019, has diluted investorsâ€™ focus on the Services opportunity for Apple and riveted investors to iPhone volume fluctuations. Given the broader sell-off in the markets and with most technology companies trading below their recent 52-week highs, we believe valuations for technology companies are more digestible currently relative to mid-2018 and would argue that it is an opportune time for Apple to leverage its strong balance sheet to further consolidate its ecosystem. Apple ended the most recent quarter with $130 bn of cash on the balance sheet and generates roughly $45 bn of free cash flow after dividends annually, which effectively puts ~$175 bn at its disposal without having to end a fiscal year with an increased debt position (in line with its long-term target of being cash neutral). Use of $175 bn can buy a lot of growth, although Apple does not have a history of large acquisitions As shown in Table 1, Apple has a history of making multiple â€œbolt-onâ€ acquisitions every year, which have largely been focused on bringing hardware technology that the company expects to be crucial to competitive differentiation in-house and better manage its development toward commercialization. In fact, Apple has been very successful with the strategy to-date as many of the applications in use on iPhones today can be associated with bolt-on technology acquisitions of the past (e.g., 3D sensing facial recognition, Siri speech recognition). Despite a track record of multiple acquisitions, the largest acquisition to date for Apple remains Beats Electronics, which was acquired for proceeds of $3 bn, while typical acquisition sizes are in the hundreds of millions. Apple's track record on acquisitions has made a lot of investors question the willingness of the current management team to explore large acquisitions. 2 447 Samik Chatterjee, CFA                       North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                            04 February 2019 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Table 1: Sampling of Appleâ€™s Acquisition Strategy Date                   Company                                       Business                                      Solution Oct-18        Dialog Semiconductor     Power management integrated circuits                       Battery Sep-18        Shazam                   Music and Image recognition                                Music Mar-18        Texture                  Digital magazine subscription service                      Books Nov-17        InVisage                 Smartphone Camera Sensors                                  Camera Oct-17        PowerbyProxi             Design wireless power solutions                            Wireless Charging Sep-17        Regaind                  Photo and facial analysis                                  Camera Sep-15        Perceptio                Advanced artificial intelligence systems for smartphones   Camera Sep-15        VocalIQ                  Speech Technology                                          Siri Sep-15        Mapsense                 Cloud-based mapping virtualization                         Maps Apr-15        Linx                     Multi-aperture camera equipment for mobile devices         Camera Aug-14        Beats Electronics        Subscription music service and audio devices               Music Jun-14        BookLamp                 Personalized book recommendations to readers               Books Jan-14        SnappyLabs               PhotoApp Developer                                         Camera Nov-13        PrimeSense               3D sensor technology                                       Face ID Oct-13        Cue                      Personal assistant app                                     Siri Aug-13        Embark                   Mobile Apps for mapping                                    Maps Aug-13        Passif Semiconductor     Wireless chip development                                  Low-power Bluetooth (Battery) Dec-11        Anobit                   Design of flash memory controllers                         Flash Memory Controller Aug-11        C3 Technologies          3D mapping software                                        Maps Source: J.P. Morgan. However, Apple has been open to changing strategic direction in the past Contrary to popular investor opinion, which questions Appleâ€™s willingness to explore opportunities outside its traditional strategy, it is worth underscoring the acquisition of Beats Electronics represented a significant change in strategy. In addition to the $3 bn purchase price, which was significantly higher than the typical acquisition price, the Beats Electronics acquisition highlighted Apple's appetite for acquiring Service businesses to stimulate growth (e.g., Beats Music) as it aimed to revitalize its floundering music business, that was largely predicated on iTunes, which was facing stiff competition from streaming services, such as Spotify and Pandora. A year after acquiring Beats Music, Apple successfully launched a rebranded music and video streaming service, Apple Music, which has since grown its paid subscriber base at a +70% CAGR to more than ~50 mn by end of FY18. By comparison, Appleâ€™s largest competitor, Spotify (covered by JPM Internet analyst, Doug Anmuth), boasts ~90 mn paid subscribers (revenue of ~$5 bn), which has grown at a +50% CAGR over a similar time period. Interestingly, with the acquisition of Beats Electronics, Apple also showed a change in strategy by illustrating a willingness to maintain the Beats brand image as it relates to its product portfolio of premium headphones and earbuds, which have also been successful to date. To that end, examples of Service businesses that we believe best fit with Appleâ€™s strategy include media content delivery platforms, such as Netflix, and gaming platforms, such as Activision and Zynga. Even hardware acquisitions could prove synergistic to certain Services offerings As we look at the importance of the Services opportunity for the company, the popular investor perception seems to be that subscription-based software acquisitions represents the greatest strategic priority. However, we do not rule out the possibility of hardware product acquisitions that could drive synergies with certain services offerings and drive accelerated pace of growth. Examples of hardware-based businesses include home platforms, such as Sonos, and health platforms, such as Peloton. 3 448 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  04 February 2019 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com The following section takes a closer look at some of the specific examples we discussed on page 1 and the potential impact on Appleâ€™s business drivers. Video Gaming The gaming industry could fit strategically in terms of services offering and provide leverage to an industry rapidly moving to the mobile platform The video gaming industry is in the midst of a physical to digital game transition with consumers increasingly purchasing content and services digitally and engaging with live services including micro-transactions, downloadable content, subscriptions, and Esports. NewZoo estimates that 2.3 bn gamers globally will spend roughly $135 bn in 2018, including slightly less than half of the spend being on mobile platforms. Additionally, within mobile platforms, 80% of the spend is expected on smartphones, while the remaining comes from a variety of devices including tablets. Looking forward, continuing on the broader trend of growth above the industry, NewZoo expects mobile gaming to grow at a strong CAGR of +13% over the next few years, outperforming the overall gaming industry growth at +9% CAGR.

High-end gaming could drive a smartphone replacement cycle and support the iPhone premium through leadership in compute/graphics capabilities Similar to the experience with the PC market, where gaming as a use case continues to drive a certain section of consumers to look for continuous hardware upgrades, we believe the increasing utilization of mobile devices for gaming can drive a replacement cycle for smartphones. For example, consumers engaged in competitive high-end gaming look for the latest compute and graphics capabilities, which can not only help drive a replacement cycle for iPhones with every launch, but could further support the premium for iPhones if Apple can maintain a leadership in terms of compute/graphics capabilities. Gaming could fit strategically into Apple's AR/VR leadership Gaming should offer synergies with Apple's iPhone hardware given well-established leadership that Apple has shown relative to 3D sensing, which would be a key enabler for augmented reality and virtual reality applications. We expect adoption of world-facing 3D sensing on iPhones in 2020, which should stimulate growth in AR/VR applications for smartphones, including on the gaming front. 4 449"

Apple guided to F2Q19 revenue in the range of $55-$59 bn for F2Q (vs. JPMe of $56.7 bn and consensus of $59.0 bn heading into the announcement), which includes $1.3 bn negative FX impact. Despite the in-line revenue guidance, gross margin outlook was modestly disappointing (range of 37.0%-38.0% vs. JPMe and consensus of 38.0% heading into the announcement), although explained largely by loss of leverage on lower volumes as well as a headwind of -90 bps y/y and -60 bps q/q from unfavorable FX. As we look to the remainder of the year, we believe the combination of moderating FX headwinds (were currencies to hold at current levels) and increasing memory price tailwinds are likely to help drive a sequential improvement in gross margins from F2Q19 levels. ï‚· Services momentum continued, helped by growth in installed base of devices. Services revenue was $10,875 mn in F1Q19 (vs. JPMe of $10,761 mn), implying growth of +19% y/y, led by strength from the App Store, Apple Pay, Cloud Services (+40% y/y), Apple Care, App Store Search Ad business and Apple Music (50 mn+ paid subscribers). The strong Services revenue growth included paid subscriptions of 360 mn in F1Q19 (vs. 330 mn in F4Q and 240 mn a year ago) and the company now expects paid subscriptions to exceed 500 mn during 2020, placing it well on track of reaching its target Services revenue by FY20 ($50 bn adjusted for accounting changes). However, at the same time Apple highlighted certain factors driving a modest deceleration in Services growth trends, relative to the strength in recent quarters, including: 1) FX impact: 60% of services revenue is derived outside U.S, thereby negatively impacted by strengthening of US dollar; 2) App Store in China: the issue of approval of new gaming titles in China was a headwind in F1Q19; and 3) Deceleration in Apple Care as it laps a year of strong performance in 2018. ï‚· Services opportunity to be driven by installed base growth and broadening content portfolio. Relative to the drivers of the Services opportunity for the company, management highlighted high-single digit growth in the installed base, which rose to 1.4 bn devices relative to 1.3 bn at end of FY17, and included 900 mn iPhones (which rose +75 mn y/y). The other primary driver of Services growth includes a broader services portfolio, as demonstrated with strong growth in recent service launches including Apple Pay and Apple Music. Additionally, Apple briefly spoke to its intent of providing original video content as well as acceleration in third- party video subscriptions to fully leverage its installed base of Apple TV devices as well as Airplay to fully leverage service opportunities on third-party hardware. ï‚· Lowering estimates largely on softer gross margin estimates and higher operating expenses. We are modestly trimming our full-year estimates for FY19E, FY20E, and FY21E to account for lower gross margins (led by loss of volume leverage and higher promotions) and higher operating expenses relative to our expectations. Our December-19 price target of $228 is unchanged, with a higher target multiple on account of greater contribution to earnings from the Services group valued at a higher multiple in the SOTP-based valuation, offsetting the impact of the lower earnings forecast. 2 520"

After November and December iPhone sales deteriorated M/M, January sales trends improved, particularly after Apple rolled back recent dollar strength in the price of iPhone XR in China. Given Apple's December quarter experience of slowing growth through the quarter, we don't believe guidance extrapolates the better January trend, leaving room for modest upside in the quarter. Additionally, Apple balance sheet inventory typically increases slightly (+$80M recent 3-year average) in the December quarter but the $1B inventory increase in December 2018 indicates Apple likely didn't push as much into the channel due to deteriorating demand, suggesting a better set-up than a year ago but also that Apple March quarter iPhone revenue will look better than Apple suppliers. Finally, after the pre-announcement on       Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a January 2nd, investors worried about the impact of lengthening replacement          result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a cycles and reduced subsidies on global, not just China, iPhone demand but           conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research.

Company-level gross margin weakness more mix than promotion driven. Heading into the quarter, investors worried that gross margins would trend toward 37% more permanently with greater promotional activity in the December quarter flowing into a price cut for iPhone XR in China in January. However, guidance for 37-38% gross margin was slightly better than feared and the margin pressure in the December quarter is almost entirely mix related. The mix shift away from iPhone (~38% gross margin) and toward other products where margins are lower (Mac, iPad, Wearables blend to a ~25% gross margin) during the December quarter explains about 35bps of the 50bps shortfall from the top-end of the 38-38.5% gross margin guidance range in the December quarter. So, while any price actions could have some modest impact on margins, the resulting mix shift toward higher margin iPhone suggests the 37-38% gross margin range is conservative. 3. Bullish tone on Services as margins expand. The December quarter marked the first quarter where Apple disclosed Services gross margin, which came in at 62.8%, up 450bps Y/Y and 170bps Q/Q, and above our 59% estimate. Additionally, many of the standalone Services segments performed well in the quarter, with App Store, Apple Pay, Cloud Services and App Store search ads all reaching quarterly revenue records. As we look forward, we remain bullish on the Services story given positive installed base trends (total active device installed base up 8% Y/Y, iPhone installed base up 9% Y/Y), a growing percentage of users that are paying for Services, a broadening of Services (with Tim Cook acknowledging for the first time Apple will launch original video content) and growth in paid subs - both at Apple Music (50M paid subs, up 11% from July '18) and total paid subscribers on the Services platform (360M, up 50% Y/Y). Plus, we believe there is upside bias to our 62.7% Services gross margins estimate in FY19 as fixed cost businesses, like iCloud, scale and China App Store revenue growth re-accelerates. 5322"

The maturing smartphone market in China has led to industry-wide headwinds, although iPhones have potentially underperformed driven by product cycle challenges as well as the recent negative sentiment against popular US brands in China. Investors will be focused on management's commentary relative to latest trends in the China market, and look for signs of a recovery in the domestic smartphone market (and iPhone shipments), which could help limit downside relative to iPhone shipment outlook. Our latest estimates call for a similar decline in 2019 as in 2018 for the China smartphone industry.

Morgan estimates. Decline in iPhone shipments in China is not new; early 2018 trends were in line- to-better than market, before a potential underperformance in C4Q18 It is important to keep in mind that the decline in iPhone shipments in China is not new. For example, starting from peak levels of iPhone shipments of 58 mn in 2015, iPhone volumes in China declined -22% y/y in 2016. Additionally, the declines in early 2018, including -7% y/y YTD (till 3Q18), appear to be largely better than or in line to the industry. Management commentary suggests an underperformance only starting in C4Q18 following the escalation in the US-China stand-off. We estimate that management commentary at the time of the pre-announcement suggested a 30% to 40% y/y decline in shipments, relative to a -20% y/y decline for the China smartphone market. Investors would be looking for a potential reversal in the US- China stand-off as early as possible to limit the impact. 2 557"

We model March quarter total revenue of $62.0B, iPhone revenue of $34.9B (units of 43M, down 18% Y/Y), Services revenue of $11.7B (+19% Y/Y), gross margin of 38.4% and EPS of $2.84 vs. consensus of $59.3B in total revenue, $33.9B in iPhone revenue (on 45.0M units), Services revenue of $11.3B, a gross margin of 38.4% and EPS of $2.65. Based on investor conversations, we believe the stock could trade up on revenue and gross margin guidance range of $58B and 38% at the mid-point, respectively, while guidance meaningfully below these levels would fuel the bear case. Services decel the biggest question mark from December pre-announcement. Following Apple's Dec Q pre-announcement, the most common question we have           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a fielded from investors is what caused reclassified Services revenue growth to        result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a decelerate to 18% Y/Y, from an estimated 25% Y/Y in the September quarter            conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider (Exhibit 2). Apple gave little detail in the pre-announcement, and therefore we'd    Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making expect the company to address the drivers of Services revenue during the             their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, earnings call. Consensus estimates assume Services growth decelerates to 14%         refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this Y/Y (vs. our expectation for 19% Y/Y growth) suggesting the bar is low and any       report. 5801 indication of temporal factors impacting December performance would be read positively. As we wrote about 2 weeks ago, we believe the slowdown was likely more temporary in nature with AppleCare (on fewer iPhone purchases in the quarter) and Licensing & Other (which includes legal settlements of which Apple was involved in a number of negative rulings in the quarter that may have impacted Services growth) the primary drivers of the slowdown. Supporting this view, Sensor Tower data showed App Store growth only decelerated 1 point in the December quarter, with a stable growth rate ex-China, an improving trend from what was a more meaningful deceleration in September 2018. Looking forward, while we expect an OTT video offering launch in the spring to help re- accelerate Services growth, one additional positive catalyst we have been monitoring is the resumption of gaming license approvals in China (China gaming is ~25% of App Store revenue and 9% of Services revenue; Exhibit 3). Yesterday, the Chinese government announced the 4th batch of gaming license approvals since December 2018, and while approvals YTD are still tracking below the same point in 2018, the number of games approved in each batch has been steadily increasing, which gives us confidence that China gaming growth can accelerate in 2019 off of the easy comps, especially in the back half of the year (Exhibit 4). Segment gross margin disclosure will highlight Services gross profit mix of 28%, compared to 18% of revenue in FY19. While we think most Street models reflect Services gross margin around 60% (Exhibit 5), Apple's new disclosures will help the Street fine-tune the breakdown and better appreciate the increasing profit contribution from Services over time. For perspective, we model Services accounting for 35% of gross profit in FY21 and 44% in FY23. While we expect fewer surprises in Apple's new segment disclosures, we liken this to when Amazon began breaking out AWS revenue and profits in F1Q15, after which company profitability improved materially as the more profitable cloud business grew faster than retail, much like we forecast services to grow faster than Apple hardware in the future (Exhibit 6). What we've heard from investors in the last few weeks. Positive sentiment on Apple has waned as multiple iPhone build cuts and negative press around macro and geopolitical headwinds have re-rated shares to their lowest point since June 2017. While short-term oriented investors are focused on March quarter guidance being a risk to owning shares, more long-term oriented investors are rethinking their valuation framework to embed a worst case scenario of iPhone replacement cycles and ASPs. For instance, assuming iPhone replacement cycles shift to 4 years from 3 years today, in-line with PCs, and iPhone ASPs remain below $800 indicating iPhone has hit a price ceiling, our SoTP implies a still attractive $185 share price (Exhibit 7) all else equal which is driving more constructive conversations with investors who can look beyond near-term headwinds. Looking at this analysis another way, Apple's current share price embeds either a 7-year iPhone replacement cycle or $450 ASP - both overly pessimistic in our view (Exhibit 8). Of course, other risks exist such as a more permanent Services deceleration or lack of impact from 2019 Services and Wearables product launches which may also be influencing SoTP valuation. The conclusion is that valuation has overshot realistic long-term fundamental outcomes barring any new risks that emerge during the January 29th earnings call. 5812 Analysis Exhibit 1: Our December quarter estimates are in-line with consensus but above street estimates in March on higher iPhone ASPs and Services revenue.

Apple's deals with media companies over the last month, including DHX media and A24, further reinforces the focus on delivering original content to increase the value of the â€œecosystemâ€, which can be monetized either through a separate â€œMediaâ€ subscription offering to consumers or through an advertisement based model similar in some aspects to Roku. ï‚· See increasing likelihood of acquisitions to accelerate transformation to Services. While Apple has executed on the Services opportunity better than expected by consensus, the headwinds to iPhone unit volumes is underscoring the need to further accelerate the transformation to Services. In addition to the focus on capitalizing on a media services opportunity organically, we see increasing likelihood of acquisitions to accelerate the transformation, including of media content delivery platforms and mobile gaming platforms to allow even stronger leverage of its installed base of devices. 2 597"

Today, Apple provided the quarterly disclosure of these reclassifications, which clarified that December 2018 Services growth was 18.3% Y/Y. We estimate this represents a 7 point deceleration from 25% Y/Y normalized growth in the September 2018 quarter, or a $600M shortfall vs. if growth was flat with Sept Q at 25% Y/Y. Importantly, recent third-party App Store data from Sensor Tower suggests App Store growth only decelerated 1 point in the December quarter, with a stable growth rate ex-China, an improving trend from a more meaningful deceleration in September 2018. Therefore we believe the Services deceleration this quarter is more temporary in nature and largely attributed to AppleCare, which was impacted by the estimated 19% Y/Y decline iPhone sales in the Dec Q and could account for as much as $425M of the shortfall. We continue to view the growing installed base (+8% in FY18), Services engagement (+14% est. revenue per device in CY18), and hardware attach (nearly 50% wearables growth in December 2018) as signs that Apple's platform value and customer loyalty continue to grow despite the weaker iPhone product cycle.

Our analysis of shipment data suggests that for the broader China smartphone market, replacement cycles have lengthened materially in the past two years (Exhibit 1), and even more so for Apple (Exhibit 2). In early December, we lowered FY19 iPhone shipments by 13M (or 6%) - from 213M to 200M - baking in a 6 month longer replacement cycle in China. But the combination of an even weaker China and continued replacement cycle lengthening in developed markets that are digesting lower subsidies and cheaper battery upgrades lead us to take FY19 iPhone units down by another 20M, to 180.25M or -17% Y/Y. China installed base data suggests healthier trends and implies weak shipments are more macro than competitive in nature.

Platform story alive and well. Even after raising our FY19 wearables estimate by 3% in December, Apple beat our non-iPhone revenue forecast by 540bps - growing 19% Y/Y vs. our estimated 13% Y/Y. In particular, Services was slightly ahead of our 27% Y/Y growth forecast, Wearables grew nearly 50%, and iPad grew double-digits, ahead of our -4% Y/Y forecast. As more Apple users buy multiple products and services, loyalty rates increase materially, helping expand the installed base even when shipments decline - a dynamic not fully appreciated by investors. Relative strength in Services also provided gross margin protection, with Apple hitting the low-end of (prior) 38-38.5% gross margin guidance despite the fact that unit shortfalls historically contribute to more meaningful margin contraction. Flowing through December quarter weakness, FY19e EPS moves to $12.39, PT to $211 (from $236). Accounting for the 11% decrease in iPhone units in the Dec Q combined with the increase in non-iPhone revenue (iPads and Wearables, Home & Accessories) and slightly higher share count drives our Dec Q revenue, gross margin and EPS to $84.1B, 38% and $4.17, from $88.8, 38% and $4.50, previously. For FY19, our estimates shake out to $262.5B, 38.4% and $12.39, from $276.9B, 38.4% and $13.50, previously and vs. current consensus of $277.9, 38.4%, and $13.28 (Exhibit 5). We mark our SOTP-driven price target to market, accounting for the recent multiple contraction in Hardware peers (where we use a blend of an HPQ and MSFT EV/Sales multiple; to 2.5x EV/2019e Sales, from 2.8x previously) and the median of 10 Services peers (to 4.4x EV/2019e Sales, from 2.8x previously), which drives our price target to $211 (from $236 previously; Exhibit 6). While we view the after hours trading price of $146/shr as an attractive entry point long-term in light of our believe that new Services and Wearables can deliver more consistent EPS growth long-term, we see shares as range bound until investors get more visibility into the March quarter on January 29th when Apple plans to report December quarter earnings. Apple's comments around accelerating initiatives to improve results, like making it simple to trade in old phones at Apple stores, suggest further actions may be taken to stabilize demand in the March quarter. 6422"

Led by the combination of the lower iPhone volume shipment outlook and slightly lower margin outlook (led by weaker revenue outlook for iPhones), we are lowering our FY19 and FY20 EPS estimates by -14% and -10%, respectively. Our out-year estimate for FY21 declines more modestly, partly on account of continued strong pace of share buybacks (Apple emphasized its target of being net cash neutral long-term) at a lower share price relative to that assumed prior driving higher earnings accretion in the out-year. Our December 2019 price target goes to $228 vs. $266 prior, led by the lower earnings outlook as well as modestly lower target P/E multiple (16.6x vs. 17.5x prior) on account of a lower earnings multiple attributed to iPhone earnings relative to prior (11.0x vs. 14.0x prior). ï‚· Updated iPhone volume forecasts. While the $7 bn revenue shortfall relative to mid-point of guidance for F1Q19 implies a roughly 9 mn volume shortfall (at $800 ASP), we estimate part of the shortfall is driven by ASP pressures stemming from higher trade-in values offered to customers in recent promotional programs. We are now lowering our calendar 2019 volume forecast to 185 mn (-10% y/y) vs. 208 mn prior, and calendar 2020 volume forecast to 190 mn vs. 210 mn prior. 2 657"

We now model Apple selling 185MM iPhones in F'19, down 10% from our prior 206MM. This is the second time in two weeks we have reduced our iPhone estimates. If we are correct, this would mark the first time since F'15 that Apple has sold fewer than 200MM iPhones. Our previous Buy call was predicated on iPhone being a mature and stable business.

Our detailed, bottoms-up Services build suggests a 5-year revenue CAGR of 19% (vs -1% for iPhone) with gross margin                                   Financial Summary of 60-66% (vs 35% for hardware), above 56% consensus. While we are reducing Net Debt (MM):                           ($122,617.0) iPhone and EPS ests for F'19, Apple's iPhone business still looks sufficient to build a massive, high margin, high multiple Services business over time.                                      Market Data We believe Apple intends to tell a compelling Services story when it discloses                                52 Week Range:           $233.47 - $150.24 gross margin for the first time ever next earnings. Ahead of this event, we are                               Total Entprs. Value:               $707.7B publishing our detailed revenue and gross margin assumptions for each key Service. Our                        Market Cap.:                       $830.4B findings suggest Services has a 19% 5-year revenue CAGR with gross margin between Insider Ownership:                    0.7% 60-66%, above consensus of 56%. The setup resembles when AMZN first disclosed AWS margin back in '15, a positive for that stock.

Apple Music is growing much                      Avg. Daily Vol.:               39,507,912 faster, from $3.7B in F'18 to $16B in F'23 (34% 5-yr CAGR), but with lower gross margin of 19%. We also provide detailed estimates for Licensing & Other, Apple Care, iCloud, iTunes, and Apple Pay, the smallest but fastest-growing (50% CAGR) of the key Services. The opportunity for investors is that these higher margin, higher growth software businesses deserve a higher multiple vs the lower margin, lower growth hardware business. Our SOTP assumes a 2.5-3.5x rev multiple for hardware and 5-8x for Services. And as Services continues to grow, delivering 41% of gross profit by F'23, this higher multiple will have an ever meaningful impact on the stock. Our optimism around Services is offset by reduced expectations for iPhone.

Our detailed, bottoms- up Services build suggests a 5-year revenue CAGR of 19% with gross margin of 60-66%, above 56% consensus. App Store and Licensing are likely the largest contributors to the Services business (35% and 23%, respectively) and have the highest gross margins (both 80%+). â€¢   Appleâ€™s subscription business alone could be worth $70B. We estimate Apple is on track to generate over $11B of subscription revenue in 2019 from its 330MM subscribers, which are split across App Store, Apple Music and iCloud. Applying a SaaS multiple of 6.0x â€™19 revenue this would imply valuation of $70B on the subscription businesses alone. â€¢   App Store is the key Services business to watch: Given the size (~13B in Source: Apple, Jefferies Estimates FY18), growth rate (20%+ CAGR â€™18-21), and margin profile (80%+ GM), the Exhibit 4: The favorable mix of services could be driving low-mid 60% App Store is one of the key drivers for Services. Lack of mobile game licensing GM for Services approval in China and developer pushback on App Store take rates are potential headwinds, but we think the LT shift to more subscription revenue and in-app monetization are strong key growth drivers.

From our discussions with Qualcomm, we understand the exclusion of newer models are                              230 driven by timing of when the litigation was filed.

We estimate China accounts for roughly ~20% of global iPhone shipments of which models included in the injunction likely account for ~40% of iPhone sales (based on global average). This implies a stop-sale on about 17 mn iPhone shipments or $11 bn on revenue (assuming an average ASP of $600). We estimate this would on a stand-alone basis translate to a ~$0.50 cent headwind to our base case earnings forecast. However, we should highlight that stop-sale on older phones will be partly offset by substitution of newer phones. Apple Inc.

We see upside on several aspects of the business as well as financials that remain underappreciated by investors, namely the transformation of the company to Services, growth in the installed base, technology leadership, and optionality around capital deployment â€• all of which together leads us to expect double digit earnings growth and a modest re-rating for the shares. Valuation Our December 2019 price target of $266 assumes a 17.5x blended P/E, which implies a re-rating from NTM trading multiple of 12.5x. Our blended P/E is arrived at based on a SOTP methodology using 14.0x P/E for iPhones, 11.0x for Mac and iPad devices, 26.0x for Services, 25.0x for Apple Watch, and 16.0x for Other Products. Key assumptions used in formulating the price target are: ï‚· iPhone: We use a 14.0x P/E multiple for our iPhone earnings estimate in calendar 2020, in line with the multiple that industry leader in the early 2000s, Nokia, traded at from 2005 to 2010 when the firm had a leadership position in feature phones. ï‚· Mac devices: P/E multiple of 11.0x, modest premium to the 10.6x NTM P/E multiple for competitor HPQ, largely subject to similar industry dynamics, but lower unit growth on account of premium pricing. ï‚· iPad devices: P/E multiple of 11.0x, in line with the multiple we assign for Mac devices as growth opportunities are limited for both notebooks as well as tablets. Additionally, we believe increasing consumption of content on smartphones is likely to substitute purchases of laptops/notebooks as well as tablets in the future. ï‚· Services: P/E multiple of 26.0x on the Services segment, in line with the average trading multiple for a peer group of luxury/retail companies (Costco, EstÃ©e Lauder and Home Depot), which are leaders in their respective markets and derive a stickiness for product sales through customer loyalty either in the form of membership programs or brand value. We believe the subscription nature of Appleâ€™s Services segment, with high visibility of revenue and earnings, warrants it being valued in line with the leading luxury/retail companies. ï‚· Apple Watch: P/E multiple of 25.0x, roughly in line with the 26.0x target multiple we use for the Services group, on account of the materially higher room for growth relative to Appleâ€™s legacy hardware products like iPhone, iPad, and Mac. ï‚· Other Products: P/E multiple of 16.0x, at a modest premium to the legacy hardware devices like iPhone, iPad, and Mac on account of higher growth opportunities. However, the 16.0x multiple is at a discount to the 25.0x multiple 2 120"

The two patents that the court accused Apple of violating deal with the resizing of and reformatting of photos and managing apps on a touch screen. According to Apple, who noted that ""all iPhone models remain available for customers in China"", the ban only applies to devices sold with iOS11. Currently, 70% of Appleâ€™s device installed base operates iOS12 (21% operates iOS11 and 9% operate an older OS) and, more importantly, all devices are currently sold with iOS12. Therefore this injunction initially appears limited in its scope, however it does add to greater headline risk for the stock and we need to monitor any impact on consumer demand for Apple products in China, which is already weak as we highlighted last week. As a frame of reference, during the 7 years of litigation between Apple and Samsung, which ended with a settlement earlier this year, Apple won an injunction against some of Samsung's smartphones models (at the time, it applied to the Galaxy S3 and earlier smartphones), however since it applied only to legacy models (similar to this injunction between AAPL and QCOM) the injunction was viewed more as a negotiating tactic than anything broader.

Importantly, our Google trends analysis suggests global demand for the new iPhones is holding up, at least relative to past cycles, after the XR launch in November (Exhibit 1) which, combined with strong uptake of higher NAND capacities and better than expected mix of XS and XS Max, suggest iPhone revenue downside is largely isolated to China. â€¦and replacement cycles are to blame. China is following in the footsteps of the US with replacement cycles lengthening after a structurally shorter cycle over the last decade. We attribute this to improving product quality across most vendors and smartphone ASPs that are up 22% in the past two years (per IDC). Our analysis of shipment data suggests that for the broader China smartphone market, replacement cycles have lengthened materially in the past two years (Exhibit 2), but for Apple, the replacement cycle lengthening in China has been    Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with more pronounced, with implied replacement even longer than the market over         companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

For analyst certification and other important disclosures, refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this But, we also see some risk of churn at the low-end of Appleâ€™s portfolio. As        report. 1521 China smartphone vendors introduce new features, like triple camera, we believe iPhone could see some share loss at that low-end of its iPhone portfolio. For example, a new Huawei Mate 20 Pro sells for 6,999RMB (256GB NAND SKU), 36% cheaper than the similarly sized iPhone XS Max (at 10,999RMB), and the features â€“ including 8-core processor, triple camera, fast charging â€“ outperform the similarly priced iPhone 8 Plus, which Apple launched a year ago. As a result, we see the possibility of Apple bringing back iPhone X at a discounted price in order to better compete at lower price points. While China smartphone installed base data points through October show Apple gaining share alongside Huawei (Exhibit 4), we see a clear divergence in unit share between the two vendors when looking at Chinese smartphone shipments through 3Q (Exhibit 5). We attribute stronger unit growth at Huawei to shorter replacement cycles relative to iPhone which wouldn't influence installed base dynamics, however, given the strong China brand line-up at the low-end of Apple's portfolio, we need to be watchful of installed base share shifts in coming months. Wearables and Services help smooth iPhone cyclicality. Importantly, weak iPhone shipments on the back of lengthening replacement cycles doesnâ€™t translate to installed base and Services weakness. Case in point â€“ the iPhone installed base grew double-digits and Services revenue growth accelerated (from 23% to 26%) in FY18 despite the fact iPhone units declined 6% in the prior two years. As a result, our 21% five year Services revenue CAGR is unchanged, and we see potential upside to the extent Apple launches new services, like Video (see here for more details) or extends new services like ads and payments, all of which are likely in our view. Additionally, our checks suggest wearables â€“ namely, Watch and AirPods â€“ continue to sell well with demand outstripping supply for AirPods two years after initial launch. For context, our supply chain conversations point to a doubling of AirPods production in FY19, which is the primary driver of our new, higher Wearables estimates. Net, Revenue and EPS still grows in FY19 despite weak iPhone units. Combining our $12B cut to FY19 iPhone revenue (via a unit cut to 200M, from 213M) and a $560M increase in Wearables revenue translates to our new FY19 revenue forecast of $277B, or 4% Y/Y revenue growth. With lower margin AirPods accounting for the majority of the increase in our Wearables forecast, we slightly lower our Wearables gross margins, which, when coupled with mix shift away from iPhone, reduces our FY19 EPS to $13.50, up 13% Y/Y but 5% lower than our prior forecast of $14.18 (Exhibit 6). We continue to think a sum of the parts approach is the best way to value AAPL shares, and we mark our price target to model, accounting for the contraction of internet/services/platform peer multiples, which drives our new $236 PT (35% upside) and assumes an Internet Services EV/Sales peer multiple of 4.6x (from 5.4x) on Services and blended Microsoft/HP EV/Sales multiple of 2.8x (from 2.7x) on Devices (Exhibit 7). 1532 Analysis Exhibit 1: Our Google Trends analysis shows recent search levels are roughly in line with the iPhone 6 and 7 cycle and only trail last year's iPhone X cycle.

Interestingly, the -19% decline in                  samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com the share price since F4Q18 earnings appears to have already priced in an overly                        J.P. Morgan Securities LLC bearish scenario of a greater than -10% volume decline in FY19E, the impact of multi-                   Joseph Cardoso year volume declines on Services, and potential new tariffs. However, based on our                      (1-212) 622-9036 checks, we do not find a need to tweak our volume forecast (206 mn/206 mn in                            joseph.cardoso@jpmchase.com J.P.

Morgan India Private Limited mn/20 mn) decline in iPhone volumes from our base case forecast in FY19E will Price Performance drive a -5%/-10% downside to earnings on a stand-alone basis, excluding the impact on Service revenue, which will be modest given JPMe 1.1 bn installed base of                            230 iPhones (~900 mn of new iPhones).

As shown in Table 2, we estimate a continued 5% decline in FY19E/FY20E/FY21E will drive a -1% downside to our FY21E EPS forecast from Services stand-alone. ï‚· Sensitivity of earnings to potential tariffs. While iPhones are not currently under the purview of any implemented or proposed tariffs, the US administration has recently mentioned the likelihood of 10% tariff on iPhones manufactured in China. Thus, based on our estimate that roughly a quarter of iPhone shipments directed to the US would be impacted by this tariff, we believe Apple is more likely to refrain from taking pricing actions to pass on the tariff impact to US consumers. As result, we estimate a ~88 bps margin headwind and a $0.45 cent EPS headwind to our FY19E earnings forecast in the scenario that these tariffs went into effect at the start of the next calendar year.

While investors generally support our Services thesis, news flow around units is creating volatility and a buying opportunity while the investor base is still in the process of transitioning away from units. Impact of revisions typically outsized at suppliers relative to Apple. While we believe investors should focus on Services rather than units, we provide our view on negative pre-announcements from Lumentum and Qorvo in response to investor questions. We believe Apple's December quarter guidance incorporates these revisions as guidance was provided less than two weeks ago. Apple also provided a wider revenue guidance range ($4B) than normal ($2B) to reflect greater demand uncertainty given the higher number of new product launches and greater macro uncertainty in the economy relative to 12 months ago.                Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a Importantly, unit revisions are typically more severe for the supply chain than        result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a Apple given inventory fluctuations and more bullish orders to ensure adequate          conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research.

Importantly, a          report. 1811 look back at the past seven negative revision at iPhone suppliers suggests these data points don't predict future share price performance, particularly beyond a one month period (Exhibit 2). China remains a wild card and the biggest risk to further pressure on iPhone demand next year. Feedback from our Apple Services note: Is there margin risk? In response to our Insight note last week, investors are asking about the risk to Services gross margin as the company invests in lower-margin areas like Music and Video. All else equal, Apple can expand company gross margin by roughly 60-80bps per year assuming a nearly 60% gross margin in Services which is growing 20% Y/Y alongside a ~35% gross margin, flattish devices business (Exhibit 3). Net, we see flexibility to modestly lower Services margin in order to drive new revenue streams and still drive overall margin expansion at the company. That said, we model Appleâ€™s highest margin Services - App Store and Licensing & Other - growing in mix, albeit slightly, over the next several years while AppleCare and iCloud margins should also scale. These dynamics actually argue for Services margins expanding in the next few years. We believe Appleâ€™s disclosure of Services gross margin likely coincides with accelerating company-level profit margins, much like when Amazon started breaking out AWS profitability in 2015 (Exhibit 4). Feedback from our Apple Services note: How resilient is Apple Services revenue in a recession scenario? Investors also asked about the resiliency of Apple in the event of an economic downturn. In this scenario, we believe Service growth could slow but likely won't decline. Looking back the great recession of 2009-10, scaled Internet services like GOOGL and NFLX saw growth decelerate but not decline, at the median (Exhibit 5). YHOO and EA and are the two exceptions, which saw revenue decline 10% and 13% respectively in 2009 before recovering to flat growth in 2010. Further, we believe more than 25% of Apple Services revenue is now subscription-based up from just 8% in 2015 (Exhibit 6). With Services and a committed buyback fueling the majority of EPS growth, we believe the company is better positioned to weather an economic slowdown relative to Apple's iPhone dependent growth historically.

We estimate iPhone volume shipments to EMs account for an estimated 46% of iPhone worldwide volumes, while DMs account for the remaining 54%. China comprises for roughly 50% of Appleâ€™s iPhone shipments to EMs, but management affirmed that it is not seeing any material change in volume trends till date in the region. Amongst the other EMs, we estimate Russia is the next largest emerging market (~7% of iPhone EM volumes), followed by Turkey, India, Vietnam, and Mexico. Interestingly, while outside of China no other EM currently accounts for a sizeable portion of volumes stand-alone, most of the key EMs for Apple appear to be navigating through a challenging macro back-drop at this time. ï‚· Emerging market currencies are driving significant headwinds. The softening macro backdrop in the EMs is driving depreciation in the local currencies of certain countries. Pricing actions taken by Apple in these EMs help to offset the translation impact of revenues from iPhone sales. However, Apple is limited in its ability to prioritize volumes through lower price increases in local currencies, to avoid price arbitrage in iPhone pricing between different countries. The average EM currency for the top six EMs (outside of China) for Apple have depreciated by roughly 15% over the levels a year ago, including high levels of depreciation in the Turkish Lira. The average depreciation over a year ago implies a similar average price increase in local currencies for iPhones in addition to the ASP increases as part of Appleâ€™s strategy to move consumers to higher-end phones, driving affordability challenges in EMs. ï‚· We look past the cyclical volume challenges in EMs to focus on secular transformation to services with increased visibility of revenue and earnings. Our conversations with management indicate that the stability of services revenues remains high and superior, relative to stability of product volumes in emerging market countries, and reinforces the long-term benefit of the firmâ€™s strategy of pursuing a transformation to services. While we understand that iPhone unit volumes could remain pressured in the current macro backdrop, we believe these challenges are largely cyclical and investors should pay greater attention to the transformation to services, where Apple was able to report quarterly record revenue of $10 bn in F4Q despite a regulatory challenge in China. 2 203"

Warranty expense was a 60bps headwind to reported gross margin, greater than the +50bps tailwind in the year ago reported gross margin. We calculate the impact of warranty expenses by comparing reported warranty expense to normalized expense based on three year average ratios to hardware revenue. Offsetting was 60bps of FX hedge gains in September, increasing from a +10bps boost in the prior year quarter. Non-designated derivates created a +30bps tailwind to reported gross margins and improved from a -40bps drag a year ago (Exhibit 1).

Growth in vendor non-trade receivables accelerated to 45% Y/Y from 20% last quarter. Net, vendor non-trade receivables and inventory grew +31% Y/Y from +36% Y/Y in the June quarter, largely in line with the average Y/Y increase during the Mar-Sept period in 2017 (Exhibit 2). Including component commitments, growth modestly decelerated to 24% from 35% last quarter and 29% on average over the past 2 years (Exhibit 3). We believe the increase in vendor non-trade receivables is a function of Apple's initiative to share purchasing power with more suppliers. 2852"

S&P500 (rebased) ï‚· That said, macro risks are noteworthy at this time for a global business, driving greater conservatism than usual in F1Q guidance. While we believe that there is not much of a shortfall relative to guidance when it comes to F1Q, it is important to remember that the firm has to navigate and execute amidst higher macro risks, particularly as relates to a softer outlook for emerging market growth, weakening EM currencies necessitating price increases, as well as softening consumer confidence in that backdrop. For example, Apple cited pressures in emerging markets including Turkey, Brazil, India and Russia and challenges in growth following price increases. Separately, while Apple continues to see solid growth in EM countries like China (+16% y/y in F4Q), it is facing regulatory hurdles relative to growth for the App Store. Net, we believe the F1Q guidance embeds a higher degree of conservatism relative to headwinds from emerging risks, which are hard to quantify, and thus an unusually wide range for the F1Q revenue outlook.

While there is no doubt that the firmâ€™s decision to move away from reporting unit sales on a regular basis is going to mitigate transparency offered to investors, we do not believe it is incrementally impactful to the bull thesis on Apple shares. iPhone unit volumes have largely plateaued since FY15 and it is well understood by investors that Appleâ€™s strategy with the iPhone revolves around driving revenue growth through ASP increases and maximizing revenue opportunities over the lifetime of a device with a customer through service offerings, relative to trying to drive unit sales/ market share. Hence, as we look at the overall implication of the firmâ€™s decision to move away from unit sales disclosures, we find it irrelevant in evaluating Appleâ€™s success on its strategy relative to smartphones. ï‚· Services revenue reports another quarter of solid growth. Services revenue was $9,981 mn in F4Q (vs. JPMe of $10,131 mn), implying growth of +17% y/y (or +27% y/y ex-accounting adjustment a year ago), led by strength from the App Store, Cloud Services, Apple Care, Apple Music and Apple Pay. On the flip side, Apple disclosed it has seen a slowdown in the App Store in China related to greater oversight on new video game approvals. However, Apple importantly stressed it does not believe this oversight is related to US-China trade issues, but is instead a domestic issue. Nonetheless, Apple boasted paid subscriptions grew to 330 mn in F4Q (vs. 300 mn in F3Q and 210 mn a year ago) as the company is well on its way to reaching its target Services revenue of $48 bn by F2020. ï‚· Double-digit growth in the active installed base continues to support solid Services growth. Appleâ€™s active installed base continued the growth momentum it has set as standard over the past several quarters as it grew double-digit percentages yet again in F4Q. The active installed base of all major product categories were disclosed to be at all-time highs, including Mac at 100 mn+. Interestingly, Apple noted the majority of customers purchasing Macs in F4Q were new to Mac, which compares to nearly half of customers purchasing iPads. Our conversation with the company indicated that the iPhone active installed base also continued to see strong growth, despite a plateau in new unit volumes, primarily led by the portion of phones sold annually to switchers relative to being directed towards replacing the installed base. ï‚· F4Q18 (Sept) results details: Total revenues tracked at $62.9 bn (vs. JPMe of $62.4 bn, consensus of $61.4 bn, and guidance of $60-$62 bn), including iPhone revenue of $37.2 bn (vs. JPMe of $36.9 bn), iPad revenue of $4.1 bn (vs. JPMe of $4.7 bn), Mac revenue of $7.4 bn (vs. JPMe of $6.4 bn), Services revenue of ~$10.0 bn (vs. JPMe of $10.1 bn), and other products revenue of $4.2 bn (vs. JPMe of $4.1 bn). Gross margin tracked better than anticipated (38.3% vs. JPMe of 38.2% and consensus of 38.3%, guidance of 38%-38.5%), driving EPS of $2.91 vs. JPMe of $2.84 and consensus of $2.78. ï‚· F1Q19 (Dec) guidance details: Apple is guiding revenue in the range of $89-$93 bn for F1Q (vs. JPMe of $93.1 bn and consensus of $92.7 bn heading into the announcement) and gross margin in the range of 38.0%-38.5% (vs. JPMe of 38.5% and consensus of 38.6% heading into the announcement). ï‚· iPhone metrics: iPhone unit shipments were 46.9 mn in F4Q (vs. JPMe of 46.1 mn), implying growth of +0.5% y/y. At the same time, blended iPhone ASPs were $793 (vs. JPMe of $801), which were up +28% y/y. 2 316"

Our SOTP- driven price target declines from $247 to $226 largely on recent multiple compression at Services peers (Spotify, Netflix, Amazon). What we learned from Apple's September quarter earnings: (+) Services growth better than feared with iPhone ASP upside. Services grew 17% Y/Y as reported and 27% normalized for a $640M favorable 1x adjustment in the year ago quarter. Services maintained momentum from 28% normalized growth in the June quarter and 31% in March despite the slow down of new game approvals in China. While the company has seen a few games approved recently, it's very far below the historic pace and the company does not know when the rate of approvals will normalize. AppleCare, iCloud and Apple Pay were called out as services that helped offset the App Store slowdown. iPhone ASPs grew       Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 28% Y/Y, above our 17%, benefitting from sell-in of the higher priced XS and XS   companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a Max. Next quarter we expect iPhone ASPs to grow 10% Q/Q, in-line with average     result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of seasonality in the 2015 and 2016 quarters given ASP growth of 30% in the          Morgan Stanley Research.

Apple provided a wider guidance range ($4B) than normal ($2B) to reflect greater demand uncertainty given the higher number of new product launches and greater macro uncertainty in the economy relative to 12 months ago with mid-point implying +45% Q/Q versus normal seasonality of 63%. Apple has reported the top-end of its revenue guidance range in 7 of the last 10 quarters so Street revenue of $93B likely won't come down materially (guidance range is $89-93B) but the weaker guide and macro commentary will be harder to digest in the current tape. Normalizing for $2B currency headwind in the quarter, the mid-point of guidance would've been in-line with consensus heading into the earnings release. As noted above, iPhone ASPs will increase Q/Q less than last year given channel fill of the higher priced SKUs happened in September this year suggesting iPhone shipments in the 72-74M range for December, only slightly below our prior 75M forecast. (-/+) Disclosure changes good long-term but creates some noise near-term. Apple announced that it will make a number of disclosure changes next quarter including not disclosing units by segment. The reality is that as the smartphone market matures, users are paying up for higher quality devices that last longer making units less of an indicator of trends than revenue. The company justified the decision to stop providing units by pointing out that units aren't correlated with recent share price performance. Long-term, removing the focus on units helps shift the investment community discussion toward Services, a positive in our view. Additionally, the company will provide revenue and gross margin breakout for products and services, providing more transparency into the earnings contribution and growth of Services. (=) FX offsets NAND benefit for stable gross margins. December quarter gross margin guidance of 38-38.5%, in-line with the past four quarters, considers a 90bps currency headwind offset by 30bps memory price tailwind. Investors expected to see more NAND price benefit in the September quarter but the work down of $2 billion of inventory likely contributed to less of a tailwind. Going forward, we continue to view 1) leverage, 2) component costs, 3) currency, and 4) mix as the biggest gross margin drivers with component costs (largely memory driven) and mix to services becoming more impactful as Apple moves through FY19. However, we lowered our FY19 gross margin forecast to 38.7%, from 39.2%, to reflect the near-term currency headwind. 3282"

App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and Apple Care all set all-time revenue records. Apple has now sold over 200MM iPhones for the last 4 yrs. To us, iPhone looks like a mature and stable business upon which Apple can now build a massive, higher-margin and higher-multiple services business. Apple will report Services gross margin for the first time on its Dec earnings release; this could be a catalyst for the stock as when AMZN first disclosed AWS margin in 2015. We believe AAPL intends to tell a positive story around Services, where gross margin could be double the hardware business and improving. As the business mix- shifts towards Services, this new disclosure can be a framework to apply multiples, etc. Apple will also stop disclosing unit sales for iPhone, Mac and iPad, fueling fears                                                             Timothy O'Shea * it has something to hide.

After years of strong growth                      Bharat Daryani between 2010 and 2013, the iPad was losing relevance in the wake of increasing                        (91-22) 6157 3057 screen sizes of smartphones. The launch of the iPad Pro in June 2017 put the tablet                   bharat.daryani@jpmchase.com much closer in capabilities to a notebook in terms of performance, while offering                     J.P.

In our view, the update to the MacBook Air is unlikely to drive a major upgrade cycle from existing customers given that the target use case is still centered around personal use relative to the greater opportunity around driving upgrades on the MacBook Pro focused on professional use cases. Interestingly, while the changes might be less relevant for an upgrade cycle of existing users, it might be a greater driver in growth to the installed base given that 51% of Mac buyers are new customers. ï‚· Expect iPad Pro updates to drive higher impact to financials. We believe the degree of hardware innovation on the latest iPad Pro and the shorter lifecycle of a tablet relative to a laptop in the installed base makes it more likely to see an upgrade cycle on the iPad installed base, driving greater impact to financials.

We see upside on several aspects of the business as well as financials that remain underappreciated by investors, namely the transformation of the company to Services, growth in the installed base, technology leadership, and optionality around capital deployment â€• all of which together leads us to expect double digit earnings growth and a modest re-rating for the shares. Valuation Our December 2019 price target of $272 is based on 17.6x blended P/E, which implies a modest re-rating from NTM trading multiple of 16.2x. Our blended P/E is arrived at based on a SOTP methodology using 14.0x P/E for iPhones, 11.0x for Mac and iPad devices, 26.0x for Services, 25.0x for Apple Watch, and 16.0x for Other Products. Key assumptions used in formulating the price target are: ï‚· iPhone: We use a 14.0x P/E multiple for our iPhone earnings estimate in calendar 2020, in line with the multiple that industry leader in the early 2000s, Nokia, traded at from 2005 to 2010 when the firm had a leadership position in feature phones. ï‚· Mac devices: P/E multiple of 11.0x, modest discount to the 12.2x NTM P/E multiple for competitor HPQ, largely subject to similar industry dynamics, but lower unit growth on account of premium pricing. ï‚· iPad devices: P/E multiple of 11.0x, in line with the multiple we assign for Mac devices as growth opportunities are limited for both notebooks as well as tablets. Additionally, we believe increasing consumption of content on smartphones is likely to substitute purchases of laptops/notebooks as well as tablets in the future. ï‚· Services: P/E multiple of 26.0x on the Services segment, in line with the average trading multiple for a peer group of luxury/retail companies (Costco, EstÃ©e Lauder and Home Depot), which are leaders in their respective markets and derive a stickiness for product sales through customer loyalty either in the form of membership programs or brand value. We believe the subscription nature of Appleâ€™s Services segment, with high visibility of revenue and earnings, warrants it being valued in line with the leading luxury/retail companies. ï‚· Apple Watch: P/E multiple of 25.0x, roughly in line with the 26.0x target multiple we use for the Services group, on account of the materially higher room for growth relative to Appleâ€™s legacy hardware products like iPhone, iPad, and Mac. ï‚· Other Products: P/E multiple of 16.0x, at a modest premium to the legacy hardware devices like iPhone, iPad, and Mac on account of higher growth opportunities. However, the 16.0x multiple is at a discount to the 25.0x multiple we use to value Apple Watch on account of lower margins for accessory sales in a more competitive market. 2 362"

The refreshed products are the first to integrate some of the new technology first offered in the iPhone X, such as Face ID (iPad Pro), a new A12X Bionic chip (iPad Pro), retina display (Macbook Air), and a new T2 security chip (Macbook Air and Mac Mini). Other improvements were mostly iterative features such as improvements in memory and storage capacity. In our view, the most impressive new feature announced was the iPad Pro's updated creative pro and gaming capabilities. Enabled by the new A12X Bionic chip, the iPad Pro is able to deliver graphics on par with the Xbox One S, creating an experience that attempts to rival console gaming with demo of NBA 2K from Take-Two Interactive. Adobe also showcased an impressive demo of image editing in Adobe Photoshop with augmented experience in Project Aero. While Mac and iPad combined only represent 17% and 11% of FY18e revenue and gross profit, respectively, today's announcements further enhance the Apple device ecosystem and enable customers to better take advantage of Apple's many Services offerings. Other Apple/iOS updates announced today include: iOS 12 was installed on more devices in the first month than any past iOS. 60% of iPhone base now uses iOS 12. Apple shipped 400M iPads to-date with more iPads sold in the last year (44.2M) than any other Notebook vendor. Active Mac installed base recently reached 100M, implying a ~5 year Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with upgrade cycle.                                                                   companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Key Takeaway While the new iPad Pro and MacBook Air could drive some upside to our iPad and Mac estimates for F'19, we didn't see anything that would be thesis changing at Apple's event in Brooklyn. Apple continues to test higher prices across all its products, and alongside Services and wearables / accessories, we continue to believe ASP is one of three primary revenue drivers across AAPL's business. Hardware prices continue to rise across product lines. Starting at $799, the new 11ï¿½ iPad Pro is 23% more expensive than the previous model's $649. Starting at $1,199, the new MacBook Air is 20% more expensive than the previous model's $999. And starting at $799, the new Mac Mini is a whopping 60% more expensive than its predecessor at $499. iPhone prices have risen 13% and 19% during the last two years. Alongside Services and Wearables, we believe rising ASPs are one of three key revenue drivers of AAPL's global business. While it is uncertain how far Apple can go with pricing over the longer term, we see clear pricing power in the near term and that Apple is clearly flexing its muscle here. Given the rising ASPs and refreshed product lines, we could see upside to our iPad and Mac estimates in F'19 although this doesn't change the longer-term thesis. Our iPad ASP and unit growth assumptions of +1% Y/Y and -1% Y/Y both seem conservative given the completely redesigned, higher priced iPad Pro. For Mac, we see upside to our unit sales assumption of +2% Y/Y. We model ASPs declining -4% Y/Y in F'19 due to a mix shift away from MacBook Pro (starts $1,299) towards the entry level MacBook Air. Not needle movers, but the new Apple Pencil ($129) and Smart Keyboard Folio are prime examples of how AAPL is encouraging people to spend on devices that seamlessly connect to the ecosystem. The 2nd gen Apple Pencil costs $129, 30% higher than the first gen, which is incompatible with the new iPad Pro. And the Smart Keyboard Folio starts at $179, about 13% more than the $159 version for the older iPad Pro. We assume the attach rate for AirPods (to iPhones) is over 12%, growing to almost 19% next year. We would assume lower attach rates for Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard Folio, but attach rates will likely also increase over time. Bottom line, after you spend 23% more for this year's iPad Pro, you also spend more on pricier accessories. We model Other revenue growing 35% Y/Y in F'18, and 25% Y/Y in F'19. Adobe and 2K Games (TTWO) presentations highlighted important use cases for iPad Pro: creative design and gaming. iPad Pro + Apple Pencil + Adobe Photoshop looks like a killer combo for any illustrator.

J.P. Morgan India Private Limited We continue to rate Apple Overweight and with a $272 Dec-19 price target. Price Performance ï‚· iPhone pricing to be primary source of upside relative to investor expectations. We are forecasting average iPhone ASP of $801 in F4Q18, led by sales of the                             230 recently launched iPhone XS Max and iPhone XS (estimated to together account for                        210 $ 190 ~40% of F4Q18 unit sales). We believe investors are underappreciating demand for 170 the higher-priced iPhone XS Max, which we expect to outsell the iPhone XS and                           150 drive ASPs higher given its base price of $1,099.

Our analysis of revenue growth for iPhone suppliers, discussed below, drives our confidence in the above consensus ASP forecasts. ï‚· Services transformation will be the other key watch point. We are forecasting Services revenue to rise 19% y/y to $10,131 mn in F4Q18, led by strong growth in the installed base of devices as well as services revenue per device in the form of increasing app store purchases, greater use of Apple Care services by channel partners, and sustained growth in TAC revenues (Google reported a +20% y/y increase). We expect Apple Music and Cloud Services to continue to demonstrate growth close to +50% y/y. We estimate Services will account for 14% of total revenue in FY18 (vs. 8% in FY12), led by strong +25% y/y revenue growth. Apple Inc.

While we already forecast strong growth in the low-double-digit percentages for the iPhone installed base and high-single digit percentages for the total installed base, based on managementâ€™s latest comments we believe growth in the total installed base of devices is running ahead of our forecast till date this year. The stronger than expected growth in the total installed base, likely driven by our underappreciation of switchers into iPad and Mac devices, could be a source of upside to our forecasted Services revenues. ï‚· Gross margin to remain range bound despite selling more expensive phones. We are forecasting gross margins to track at 38.2%, within the guidance range of 38.0%-38.5%, and roughly similar to the 38.3% reported in F3Q18. While we see margins tailwinds from the decline in memory prices and greater leverage on indirect costs on the sequentially higher revenue, at the same time lower margins on new products immediately following the launch and stronger USD are likely to pressure margins sequentially. ï‚· Analysis of iPhone supply chain increases our confidence in our revenue and ASP forecasts. We are tracking a sample set of Apple suppliers, all of which individually obtain more than 50% of their revenue from Apple. As illustrated in Figure 1, we believe the revenue growth of suppliers that have reported September- end quarter already points to a strong increase in iPhone ASPs â€“ in line with our expectation. Additionally, as shown in Figure 2, the momentum displayed by the sample set of suppliers in the September-end quarter with revenues increasing +26% y/y, drives our confidence in F4Q18 iPhone revenue growth forecast of +28% y/y. ï‚· F4Q18 expectations: We forecast iPhone shipments of 46 mn, helping to drive total revenues of $62.3 bn, slightly above the high-end of the guidance range of $60-$62 bn, on better iPhone ASPs. Additionally, we forecast gross margins of 38.2%, in line with guidance range of 38.0%-38.5%. The combination of higher than expected revenue and in line gross margin drives our above consensus EPS of $2.84 (vs. consensus of $2.78). ï‚· F1Q19 guidance expectations: We expect investors will also be highly focused on the F1Q19 guidance and look to draw conclusions around the mix of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max relative to the recently launched and lower-priced iPhone XR. We forecast iPhone shipments of 76 mn in F1Q19, with the iPhone XR comprising 47% of mix of the 2018 generation phones. We estimate total revenues of $93.1 bn (slightly ahead of consensus of $92.8 bn), gross margin improvement sequentially to 38.5% (helped by volume leverage), and EPS of $4.91 (vs. consensus of $4.93). ï‚· Apple Watch to generate momentum, although likely to be fully realized and drive upside to F1Q19 expectations. With the September launch event standing out relative to the upgrade to the Apple Watch, we believe the momentum of the Series 4 Apple Watch will be in focus on the earnings call. However, we believe investors will fully realize the acceleration in Apple Watch shipments in F1Q19 (Dec-quarter) with the Series 4 watch likely featuring as a top grossing holiday gift item, following an expansion of the total addressable demographic with introduction of health-based functionalities in addition to fitness functionalities. ï‚· Apple can outperform through upside drivers from recent product refreshes and acceleration in share buybacks. The sell-off in the broader market has been accompanied by a sell-off in â€œmegaâ€ cap technology stocks.

Applying a higher multiple compared to the lower margin Net Debt (MM):                        ($129,143.0) hardware business, we see a significant opportunity for investors as Services alone could be worth $111 to $177 per share by that time.

Daily Vol.:               32,138,772 than Street. Applying a higher 5-8x sales multiple to our F'22 est implies Services could be worth $111-177/share over time, a significant opportunity. Services growth will be led by App Store and Apple Music, and we see an opportunity to introduce new services over time. The high margin App Store should cross $15B in rev (+33% Y/Y) in F'18. And the low margin but recurring Music business should cross $4B revs (+65% Y/Y) in F'18. And despite our view Apple Music is not the top-tier service in its category, it gained ~50MM paid subs in <3 yrs (took Spotify 12 yrs to 83MM), highlighting the power of distributing services directly into the Apple ecosystem. Wearables also driving accelerating growth in Other revenue. AirPods and Watch should account for $13B rev (+48% Y/Y) in F'18.

We believe iPhone is a mature and stable business atop which Apple can build a valuable Services business over time. Apple will have sold over 200MM iPhones in each of the last four years. While we expect solid iPhone revenue growth in Fiscal 18 and Fiscal 19 driven by higher prices, flat or even modestly declining iPhone unit sales should be sufficient for Apple to build a massive, high margin and recurring Services business over time. India looks like a large call option but is not factored into our estimates. We conservatively model iPhone units declining every year through Fiscal 2022. 2.         Services alone could be worth $111 to $177 per share by Fiscal 2022, a significant opportunity. Already a big business with accelerating growth, by Fâ€™22 Services could drive over $80B+ of revenue, accounting for 25% of total revenue and a full 40% of gross profit. Despite Apple Music not being the top tier service in its category, it gained almost 50 million paid subscribers in just three years, underscoring the power of distributing services directly into the Apple ecosystem. Our SOTP model assumes a 6 to 9x multiple for Services (vs historic 3-4x for hardware), implying investors could see significant upside as Apple scales its existing business, while introducing new services over time. 3.         Wearables looks like another large growth opportunity. AirPods and Watch should account for over $13B of revenue in Fiscal 2018, up 48% Y/Y. These products seem like sustainable growth opportunities as users are increasingly willing to spend heavily on devices and accessories that plug into Appleâ€™s ecosystem. Over time we look for Apple to launch new products like AR/VR glasses, hearing aids, and health or fitness trackers. page 5 of 83                                                                                                   Timothy O'Shea, Equity Analyst, (212) 284-3415, toshea@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 79 - 83 of this report. 410 AAPL Initiating Coverage October 29, 2018                                     Takeaways KeyTakeaways Key                     Valâ€™n / Metrics   iPhone               Services                              Wearables Three Primary Revenue Growth Driversâ€¦                                                                  Exhibit 1: Quarterly Services Revenue ($K) $12,000,000 â€¢ Services: Appleâ€™s Services business is on track to cross $10,000,000 $38B (28% Y/Y) in Fâ€™18.

The multiple spiked over 25x in 2009 as iPhone was ramping. More recently the multiple has ticked up, which we attribute to increased comfort around iPhone, the massive share buyback opportunity, and more importantly, a mix-shift to a higher margin services revenue stream which we believe still looks undervalued on a SOTP basis.                                                                Source: FactSet Exhibit 6: Apple Historic NTM EV / Sales â€¢   EV / Sales has fluctuated over time, but has historically settled around 3.0x to 4.0x. We use EV / Sales in our SOTP to compare AAPLâ€™s Services business with other Internet and Software names. A large ($38B est Fâ€™18), rapidly growing (28% Y/Y est Fâ€™18), and more recurring business, we argue Services should warrant a significantly higher EV / Sales multiple than for the core hardware business.

Apple has sold over 200MM iPhones for each of the last four years, suggesting a mature and stable business. Even in China where growth has recently lagged, we believe Appleâ€™s market share is stable with its high-spending user base. Modestly declining iPhone unit sales should be sufficient for AAPL to build a massive, high margin and recurring Services business over time. 2.      We believe Apple has pricing power with the iPhone. For the 2nd straight year, we believe significant pricing increases will be absorbed with little to no pushback. ASP growth should drive upside to iPhone revenue estimates. 3.       India looks like a call option; our model assumes no credit. From an iPhone perspective, India looks like China from ten years ago, a time horizon when Appleâ€™s China business grew 50-fold. Androidâ€™s early success may be difficult to overcome, however. page 15 of 83                                                                                                  Timothy O'Shea, Equity Analyst, (212) 284-3415, toshea@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 79 - 83 of this report. 420 AAPL Initiating Coverage October 29, 2018                                  Key Takeaways          Valâ€™n / Metrics     iPhone iPhone            Services        Wearables Exhibit 11: Visualizing Apple Stock During iPhone Hardware Cycles iPhone Xs, Xs Max iPhone X iPhone 8, 8 Plus iPhone 6s, 6s Plus iPhone 6,                  iPhone 7, 6 Plus                     7 Plus iPhone 5 iPhone 4s iPhone 5s, 5c iPhone 4 iPhone 3Gs iPhone         iPhone 3G 4G LTE,                Large                   Headphone Touch                                                      Face Hardware              Siri       Lightning              ""Plus""                      Jack ID                                                        ID Redesign                         Connector              Display                   Removed Source: FactSet, Jefferies Research page 16 of 83                                                                                                             Timothy O'Shea, Equity Analyst, (212) 284-3415, toshea@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 79 - 83 of this report. 421"

Coupled with slower Chinese gaming approvals, decelerating gaming/luxury brand growth in China, and implications of a potentially escalating trade tensions, we see China exposure as the biggest near-term risk. However, we believe that many of the App Store blemishes we cite below are more temporary in nature and as a result, continue to believe in the longer-term sustainability of App Store growth, which plays a meaningful role in our bullish Services thesis. China growth continues to decelerate while the US maintains 30%+ growth and Japan accelerates. China remains the single largest revenue generating country for the App Store, producing slightly more than $1B in net revenue in the September quarter and accounting for 29% of total App Store net revenue, slightly lower than the T12M average of 31%. China App Store growth has now decelerated for 8 consecutive quarters, largely due to the after-effects of a         Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a pause in gaming license approvals in the country (see next paragraph), with           result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a growth in the most recent quarter falling to 16% Y/Y (Exhibit 3). On an ex-China      conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider basis, September quarter App Store net revenue would have grown 26% Y/Y,              Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making implying the slowdown in China accounted for 1pt of the deceleration in the           their investment decision. quarter (Exhibit 4). In the US, App Store net revenue growth decelerated to 36%       For analyst certification and other important disclosures, refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this Y/Y in C3Q (from 42% growth in C2Q) but remained meaningfully higher than the         report. 5061 previous 6 quarter average growth rate of 29% (Exhibit 5). Lastly, after growing at a low single digit percentage for the past two quarters, Japan's App Store net revenue meaningfully accelerated to 12% Y/Y in C3Q (Exhibit 6). Countries outside of the top 3 continue to become more meaningful contributors to revenue growth this year, and now account for just under one-third of the App Store's net revenue growth YTD vs. just 20% in 2017. (Exhibit 7, Exhibit 8). Gaming growth largely unchanged from C2Q but results more mixed beneath the surface. Gaming-related app downloads and in-app purchases continue to drive the majority of App Store revenue, accounting for 71% of App Store net revenue in the September quarter and contributing close to half of App Store Y/Y revenue growth. Globally, gaming related revenue grew 13% Y/Y, a 40bps acceleration from C2Q18 (Exhibit 9), as strength in US (+25% Y/Y; Exhibit 10) and Japan (+7% Y/Y, an 800bps acceleration Q/Q ; Exhibit 11) offset weakness in China. While the gaming-related results in the US and Japan are encouraging, the 250bps deceleration in gaming-related net revenue (from 10.4% in C2Q to 7.9% in C3Q; Exhibit 12) in China is more concerning but almost certainly a direct result of the pause in gaming license approvals by Chinese regulators, which started in March and will reportedly last through the rest of the year, as approval responsibility shifts to the State Administration of Press and Publication. For example, the Financial Times reported earlier this month that over 9,000 new games were approved in 2017 in China vs just 1,932 YTD, which speaks to the severity of this year's approval slowdown. And while we expect a stricter license approval policy going forward, we view this slow down in China gaming-related revenue as temporary, and believe any efforts on the regulatory front to speed up new gaming license approvals would be a positive catalyst towards re- accelerating growth. Declines in non-gaming categories weighed on growth in C3Q. Revenue growth from all other categories besides gaming, such as entertainment, social networking, and music, remains very strong but decelerated slightly to 60% Y/Y in C3Q, from 70%+ in the prior 3 quarters, with the most notable deceleration coming from Entertainment, the second largest revenue-generating category after gaming (Exhibit 13). App Store growth is increasingly dependent on these categories that now contribute 57% of overall App Store growth, up from 41% in the year ago quarter (Exhibit 14). In C3Q, Entertainment growth decelerated from 130% Y/Y in C2Q to 87% Y/Y in C3Q. Revenue growth of Social Networking and Music-related apps, the #3 and #4 largest App Store categories, respectively, decelerated by 5pts and 15pts in C3Q, to 23% Y/Y and 37%, respectively. Bigger picture however, revenue growth from all non-gaming categories is up 68% YTD, an acceleration from growth of 63% in 2017, so the slowdown in the September quarter is not yet something we'd point to as a worrisome trend. Overall impact to our Services thesis is limited, with Chinese new gaming license approvals a key to 2019 re-acceleration. Remain OW with $247 PT. Despite the September quarter shortfall in App Store net revenue vs. our estimates and the meaningful role the App Store plays in Apple's Services business (it accounts for ~40% of Services revenue), we are hesitant to adjust our Services revenue estimate given the potential for upside in other categories. Over the past year, Licensing & Other, the App Store, and AppleCare contributed to upside to our Services growth estimates. Additionally, our September quarter Services revenue estimate of $10.0B assumes a 7% decline in Apple's Licensing & Other line, which 5072 includes GOOGL TAC payments, which we view as potentially conservative in light of our Internet team forecasting GOOGL mobile TAC payments growing 43% in the September quarter. As we approach 2019, the new gaming license approval situation in China remains the most important App Store-related storyline to follow, given the importance of both China and Gaming to the App Store. Nevertheless we believe this issue will be temporary given the importance of the gaming market in China but also expect smaller/faster growing countries to continue increasing in importance, providing the end-market diversification needed to sustain App Store growth over a multi-year period. Note, Sensor Tower updates their Store Intelligence dataset 3-4 times per year as they accumulate new publisher and developer data points over time. On a country or store level, these updates result in revisions that are rarely more than low- single-digit percentage point changes in either direction. In this latest update, cumulative App Store net revenue between 1Q14 and 2Q18 decreased by $64M, resulting in historical App Store net revenue growth rates that slightly differ from our previously published estimates. Exhibit 15 details these revisions. 5083"

We estimate that while more than half of the new iPhone volumes in any particular year are purposed to replace/upgrade existing iPhone users, the remaining demand is driven by customers switching from android platforms to iOS platforms (led by the technologically superior product delivered by Apple) and (less so) by new subscribers. Our key estimates for the installed base include: 1) We estimate the iPhone installed base to be close to 1 bn devices, accounting for the primary portion of the total installed base; and 2) Roughly 20% of the installed base of iPhone units is comprised of secondary owners while roughly 80% of the installed base is still with the primary owners.

We believe the secondary installed base for iPhones is underappreciated by investors and so is the opportunity for Apple to expand the installed base of secondary unit owners, which we do not currently model. We believe the brand positioning and the longer life-cycle of iPhone hardware relative to hardware from mass market smartphone OEMs drive a strong ~50% market share of the secondary market for Apple, which we believe can continue to expand (particularly in the emerging markets â€• which we donâ€™t currently model and can present upside to our estimates. Additionally, our installed base model does not count new products which still remain modest in overall volumes, for example: HomePods. We see opportunities for stronger growth in the installed base if Apple were to demonstrate stronger growth with newer products like HomePods. ï‚· Lack of iPhone shipment growth over last couple of year appears to be less of a concern; investors appreciate focus on profitability in a tough end-market. While concerns on pricing abound, the lack of meaningful increase in iPhone shipments over last couple of years does not appear to be as concerning to investors on a stand-alone basis, led in part by greater appreciation for Apple's strategic focus on profits relative to unit volumes in a tough end-market. However, there is a greater concern from investors on the implications of the plateau in iPhone unit volumes to the Services opportunity. ï‚· Investors appreciate the Services story, but are largely expecting continued progress rather than acceleration. While the firmâ€™s strategic focus on Services opportunity is widely discussed by investors, our conversations indicate that most investors expect Services growth to track at a similar or modestly lower pace relative to the +18% Services revenue CAGR demonstrated over the last 5 years. However, we expect acceleration in Services growth, despite the moderation in installed base growth, led by: 1) Continued increase in time spent by consumers on mobile devices to drive higher engagement and revenues from the App Store; 2) Greater adoption of Apple Care services by third-party distributors; 3) Continued strong growth in Apple Music and Apple Pay, both of which will contribute an increasing portion of Services revenues over time. 2 525"

More recently, investors have been proved wrong on the pace of Appleâ€™s transformation to a services company, with revenues in the Services reporting segment increasing from 8% of total in FY12 to an estimated 20% of total in FY21E. The Services opportunity is currently derived primarily from App Store purchases and there are multiple emerging drivers, such as Apple Music and Apple Pay, which should continue to drive strong growth. We forecast +23% revenue CAGR for Services (including comfortably hitting the FY20E Services revenue target of $48bn) with modestly better than company-wide margins to be accretive to profit growth, and accompanied by higher visibility to revenue and earnings, which we believe warrants a higher earnings multiple relative to the core hardware business. Apple Music and Apple Pay levered to megatrends of streaming music and digital currency, which are emerging growth areas for Services Apple Music and Apple Pay are key additions to the Apple ecosystem levered to consumer behavior megatrends in the form of the shift from downloading to streaming music and the increasing adoption of mobile payments. We expect Appleâ€™s subscription-based Music service to reach >100mn MAUs by FY20E through increasing penetration of a target market estimated by J.P. Morgan Internet analyst, Doug Anmuth, to total 2.7bn users, thus remaining the second largest music streaming service globally after Spotify. We forecast annual revenues to grow at a +41% CAGR to $16bn by FY21E. Separately, Apple Pay is gaining traction with the installed base and already leads competitive product offerings on Samsung or other Android platforms. We forecast ~$2.2bn in revenues from Apple Pay by FY21E with a +48% CAGR, led by the broader industry trend of strong growth in use of mobile payments and increase in NFC-enabled merchants. Apple to expand media offering to consumers with the addition of video, newspaper, and magazine content We expect Apple to expand its media offering beyond music by adding video and print media content, resulting in an all-encompassing Media subscription. We expect Apple to ramp up its investments in video content steadily starting with ~$1bn in 2018. We expect a steady increase in investments in video content, given Appleâ€™s focus on differentiation through content rather than encouragement of cord-cutting. However, the level of investments is unlikely to reach Netflixâ€™s $8bn and Amazonâ€™s $5bn over our forecast window (FY21E). We expect Apple to combine the video and print media offering (through acquisition of Texture) to offer a packaged subscription at $14.99/month relative to $9.99 for Apple Music and drive Apple Music subscribers to upgrade to the packaged subscription, while at the same time growing the subscriber base at a rapid pace. We estimate Appleâ€™s incremental media offerings beyond Music to drive an incremental $2.8bn of revenues by 2025. Missing the forest for the trees: Concerns about iPhone volumes have driven investors to overlook the robust growth in the installed base In addition to the increase in service revenue opportunity per device, growth in the installed base of Apple devices is the other primary contributor to the growth in new 3 545 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Services revenue. While investors have been concerned about the modest growth in iPhone volumes, Apple has still been able to drive double-digit increases in the installed base through a combination of 1) new subscribers; 2) incremental consumer switching to iOS; and 3) replacement units from existing iOS users making it to the secondary market (we estimate Apple has a 50% share of the secondary market relative to 15% of new smartphone market). We estimate a total installed base of 1.4bn devices in 2017 (~1bn iPhones) rising to 1.9bn by 2021 or a +7% CAGR. Pricing power, driven in part by differentiation on technology, will continue to surprise investors on the upside Investors have been pleasantly surprised by the limited price elasticity exhibited by customers, which includes the increase in iPhone volumes despite a +3% pricing CAGR over the last ten years (and a higher increase in retail price in certain countries due to roll-off of carrier subsidies). Consumers have been willing to pay higher ASPs, due to a combination of: 1) stickiness of the iOS platform (including smartphones and accessories like watches) through technology differentiation; 2) increasing use of financing to pay in installments; and 3) push-out of spend on laptops and tablets. Our analysis reveals that Apple has an exceptional track record of success with the top-of-the-line smartphone marketed each year and with larger screen size smartphones (generally priced at a premium), relative to Appleâ€™s primary competitor in the high-end smartphone category, Samsung. The latest generation of iPhones launched on September 12, with base prices ranging from $1,099 at the high-end to $749 at the low-end, is set to continue to drive ASPs higher. Apple to drive differentiation of the ecosystem through technology leadership Appleâ€™s portfolio strategy of focusing on design of three iPhone models each year allows it more bandwidth for resources to drive technology leadership and quality assurance, which are crucial in maintaining price premium over competitive products and driving a longer life-cycle of the product (which supports installed base growth). Apple is already comfortably ahead of competition in relation to facial recognition modules. JPM Asia Technology analyst, Narci Chang, expects world facing 3D Sensing to be adopted on iPhones starting in 2019 (see report), again comfortably ahead of competition. Similarly, optimism around foldable smartphones has increased in recent months; we expect Apple to be a fast follower with adoption starting in 2021 (see report) if it finds the form factor gaining traction with customers. Appleâ€™s technology leadership drives both new customers joining the iOS installed base (an estimated one-third of annual demand) and replacement demand led by upgrades from existing customers (roughly two-thirds). Acceleration in revenue growth to be a catalyst for investor sentiment; buybacks to boost earnings growth further We expect a +10% revenue CAGR between FY17 and FY21, accelerating from the +8% CAGR over the last five years, led by a combination of high-single-digit revenue growth in iPhones and double-digit revenue growth in Services and â€œOther Productsâ€ revenues. The acceleration in revenue growth should drive investor attention to the change in the drivers of revenue growth from being primarily led by iPhone revenues historically, to a balance between iPhone, Services, and Other Product revenues over our forecast window. We expect the +10% revenue CAGR to translate into a +17% earnings CAGR over the forecast window (FY21E), through deployment of capital in share buybacks on a continual basis. 4 546 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Enormous capital deployment opportunity provides optionality The firmâ€™s target of being net cash neutral in the long-run relative to the net cash position of $129bn at end of F3Q18 and strong free cash flow generated annually (average of $54bn annually over last five years) provides an enormous opportunity for capital deployment. However, we believe medium-term upside to our base case estimates (based on buybacks largely in line with free cash flow) is likely from large buybacks or acquisitions. For example, we estimate annual buybacks of $100bn can help Apple can reach close to a cash neutral position by FY21E, with accretion of ~$2.25 to our FY21E EPS. On the downside, however, our base case forecasts embed largely flat operating margins, and we estimate the proposed tariffs, if implemented, could be a modest headwind of 50bps on operating margins medium- term and moderate our earnings growth forecasts. Expect M&A to focus on Services opportunities and large installed base; Video Gaming, Automotive, and Smart Speakers could be potential opportunities While Apple has historically acquired hardware companies, it has largely been to bring certain technologies in-house and have the ability to further develop them. We expect bolt-on acquisitions of hardware companies to continue as the firm continues to evaluate technology differentiation for future generation of products. However, recent acquisitions of Texture, and Shazam, are more typical of acquisitions we would expect Apple to focus on moving forward to further enhance the Services offering to its existing installed base. Additionally, we do not rule out Apple looking at other end-markets with a combination of a large installed base and associated opportunity to deploy services. We believe mobile video gaming and the automotive end-market could be of interest in this regard, in addition to potential interest in the smart speaker end-market given lackluster performance of the HomePod to date. Stronger track record of profitability than other technology leaders; yet trading at only market multiples makes it attractive to both value and growth investors Interestingly, with annual revenues of $230bn, Apple is ahead of other technology leaders, including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix (all covered by JPM Internet analyst Doug Anmuth). In greater contrast, Appleâ€™s $61bn in operating profit compares to $26bn for Alphabet, $20bn for Facebook, $4bn for Amazon, and $0.8bn for Netflix. Additionally, the firm has a historical track record of much stronger earnings growth than the S&P 500 index, of which it is the largest constituent at ~5% weight. However, AAPL shares still trade at 16.6x NTM P/E, modestly below the market multiple and well below trading multiples of other technology leaders. We expect the combination of double-digit earnings growth and a trading multiple in line with the market to screen very attractively for both value and growth investors (although AAPL is part of only the S&P 500 growth index). We rate Apple shares Overweight with solid +23% upside potential to our December 2019 price target of $272 We rate AAPL shares Overweight given our favorable outlook on iPhone and Services revenues relative to investor expectations, catalysts to accelerate revenue growth, and upside risk to our base forecast for +18% earnings CAGR. We expect increasing appreciation of acceleration in growth, along with greater visibility into earnings and cash flow with increasing mix of Services, to drive a modest re-rating, from NTM trading multiple of 16.6x to a 17.5x blended P/E, which we arrive at a based on a SOTP methodology using 14.0x P/E for iPhones, 11.0x for Mac and iPad devices, 26.0x for Services, 25.0x for Apple Watch, and 16.0x for Other Products. We see +23% upside to our December 2019 price target of $272. 5 547 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Risks to Rating and Price Target Industry Downside Risks Deceleration or contraction in the handset and smartphone market could be faster than expected Economic conditions or shifting consumer demand could cause greater-than- expected deceleration or contraction in the handset and smartphone markets. This would negatively impact Appleâ€™s prospects for growth, and the shares may fail to achieve our target price as a result. Increase in competitive pressures in international markets Apple is increasingly participating in international markets, such as China and India, where local players, which are better situated, could leverage their position and pull on levers such as pricing to make the market more competitive. In addition, tariffs enacted by local governments may further hurt Appleâ€™s ability to effectively compete in international markets. Company-Specific Downside Risks Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could be fruitless Apple has historically invested in new business strategies and acquisitions. As such, success on these investments has low visibility at this time and could lead to greater- than-expected liabilities and expense. Additionally, new investments could have a negative impact on current operations by distracting management. Key man risk around departure of chief executive officer While risks related to departure of management executives is considerably lower relative to in the past, we believe the execution on strategic priorities under CEO Tim Cookâ€™s leadership does still present modest risk to the share price, although we see a strong group of executives to support business performance without disruptions. Litigation with Qualcomm could drive unexpected liabilities As part of risk mitigation from the ongoing litigation with Qualcomm, Apple has provisioned what management believes could be worst-case payments to Qualcomm in the event of an adverse judgement. However, less favorable outcomes with greater damages awarded to Qualcomm could be a liability for Apple beyond the provisions, and drive downside to our price target. 6 548 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Key Themes for AAPL Stock Transformation to Services Faster than Expected Forecast Services to grow to one-fifth of revenues by FY21E Investors have been pleasantly surprised on the pace of transformation to Services, particularly given the size of the hardware business with ~215mn smartphone units sold annually. However, with strong double-digit growth (+18%) CAGR over the last five years, Apple has more than doubled the FY12 revenue of $13bn by FY17 ($30bn). We forecast a modestly stronger +23% CAGR through FY21E, including comfortably achieving its target of doubling the FY16 revenue of $24bn by FY20E (JPMe $56bn). Growth will be driven both by increase in the installed base from 1.4bn devices in FY17 to 1.9bn by FY21E at a +7% CAGR, and an increase in service revenue per installed device at a 16% CAGR.

Apple Music to account for $30bn by 2025, led by strong subscriber growth Appleâ€™s Music service, based on monthly subscriptions, is second only to Spotify globally and we see adequate room for growth for both players in a market where consumers are switching to streaming services relative to download purchases. Streaming revenues for the industry have grown at a +59% CAGR since 2012 and we expect the same to continue with Apple Music gaining further penetration of the estimated (by J.P. Morgan Internet analyst, Doug Anmuth) TAM globally of 2.7bn users relative to its current subscriber base of >50mn. We expect Apple to reach 106mn subscribers by FY20 and 262mn by FY25, accounting for an estimated $30bn of revenues by FY25. 7 549 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Figure 2: Apple Music Revenue Forecast $ in Billions $35 $30 $30                                                                          $27 $25                                                                $23 $19 $20 $16 $15                                 $12 $9 $10 $6 $4 $5 $0 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Source: Company reports and J.P. Morgan estimates. Media services, including original video, to be the next big driver for Apple News reports (see link) indicate that Apple is looking to invest around $1bn into original video programming initially to drive exclusive content and we expect investments to steadily ramp further over time. However, investments will remain lower than Netflixâ€™s $8bn and Amazonâ€™s $5bn levels through our forecast window (FY21E), primarily as Apple is looking to add exclusive content to the media platform rather than position itself as an alternative to cable, Netflix or Amazon Prime. Additionally, we expect Apple to add print media subscriptions, building on the recent acquisition of Texture to further enhance the services offering. We believe Apple is likely to look to consolidate the media services by tying together existing Music services and original video and print media. We expect the Apple Media subscription to be priced at a premium to the existing Music subscription; we assume pricing of $14.99 for individual subscriptions (vs. $9.99 for Music) and $19.99 for family subscriptions (vs. $14.99 for Music). We also expect 35% of Apple Music subscribers to upgrade to the all-encompassing Media service by FY25E, and account for an incremental $3bn of revenue in FY25E.

In consumer surveys, Apple Pay has had stand-out feedback with materially better adoption within installed base of devices relative to other competing platforms on Android devices, including those of primary premium smartphone competitor, Samsung. We expect Apple Pay revenues to rise at a +38% CAGR through FY25 to $6bn.

Growth in Installed Base Underappreciated Investors have been concerned relative to modest volume growth in iPhone in the backdrop of plateauing smartphone volumes iPhone volumes rose quickly from 11mn units in the first year after the first iPhone launch (FY08) to peak at 231mn units in FY15, before moderating to FY17 volumes of 217mn. The combination of Appleâ€™s current three-fourths market share in the premium smartphone market and expectations for flat volumes for the handset and smartphone market have raised concerns relative to maturity of the smartphone market and Appleâ€™s position in it, leading to limited opportunities for volume growth. We acknowledge the modest volume opportunity for iPhones, particularly when every generation of smartphones is accompanied by price increases, and forecast +1% volume CAGR through FY21E. 9 551 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Figure 5: Apple iPhone Shipment Forecast Units in Millions 240                              231 217     217            218    221 220                                      212                    214 200 180                       169 160                150 140       125 120 100       FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 Source: Company reports and J.P.

However, we believe investors are missing the forest for the trees: Installed base demonstrating robust growth feeding into strong Services growth While investors have been focused on iPhone volumes sold annually in the primary market, the driver fueling the transformation to Services has been the expansion in the installed base which has demonstrated double-digit growth to date. Going forward, growth in the installed base is likely to moderate to a high-single-digit pace, but still implying growth of roughly 100mn units in the installed base of devices every year relative to flat volumes in the primary market. The high-single-digit expansion in the installed base is led by new consumers switching to the iOS platform, new subscribers, and a high portion of replacement units making their way to the secondary market where we estimate iPhones have a 50% market share relative to ~15% market share of the new smartphone market.

Despite the increase in prices, iPhone volumes have not shown any significant signs of decline and investors have been pleasantly surprised by the limited price elasticity exhibited by consumers. Banking on the limited price elasticity demonstrated by consumers, Apple pivoted to a more aggressive pricing strategy with the launch of the iPhone X at a base price of $999 in 2017, which has put the firm on track for a high-teen percentage increase in pricing for FY18E. The latest generation of iPhones released on September 12 this year now has the top-end product with a base price $1,099 and the low-end product with a base price of $749, setting up the firm for another year of strong price increase, by our estimates.

Morgan estimates. Better track record of driving the premium pricing strategy relative to peers Our analysis shows Apple has a better track record relative to competition with driving consumer adoption of the top-end phone in its portfolio. For example, iPhone X has accounted for one-third of total iPhone shipments to date and Appleâ€™s top-end iPhones accounted for 14%-38% of total shipments over the last six quarters, which compared to a range of 3%-24% for Samsung. Similarly, Apple has a solid track record with larger screen size phones (marketed popularly as Plus Size models) with shipments of these premium models accounting for an increasing portion of total shipments, roughly in line with Samsungâ€™s track record with a much broader set of smartphone models offered in larger screen sizes. Pricing strategy is sustainable as consumers are willing to pay more for smartphones, which are dis-intermediating other IT hardware spend We believe the pricing strategy is sustainable and expect limited price elasticity from consumers led by: 1) stickiness of the iOS platform with the combination of the iPhone and accessories, including watches; 2) smartphone capabilities increasing and substituting demand for laptops and tablets, pushing out the replacement cycle led consumer spending on these devices; 3) consumers spending an increasing amount of time on a smartphone; and 4) consumers increasingly using financing to convert the high retail prices into affordable monthly payments. 11 553 Samik Chatterjee, CFA                                North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                                     27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Pricing strategy to drive change in composition of iPhone revenue growth, with surprises led by pricing strength We forecast solid growth in iPhone revenue from iPhone sales, despite heightened investor concerns around both volumes and pricing. We expect growth in revenues from iPhone sales to moderate from +12% CAGR over the last five years to a +9% CAGR for FY17-FY21E, but still surprise on the upside relative to investor expectations led by a greater contribution from price increases.

Capital Deployment Provides Option Value to Investors Target of neutral net cash position long-term provides optionality to investors Apple ended F3Q18 with $244bn of cash on the balance sheet and with debt of $115bn, leading to a net cash position of $129bn. Additionally, the firm has generated on average free cash flow of $54bn over the last five years. Apple has not put a timeline to its net cash neutral target, but the availability of up to $291bn or ~30% of the market cap to deploy over FY19E-21E through a combination of dividends, share repurchases, and M&A provides enormous option value to investors in terms of upside to earnings. Embed increased share repurchases and dividend in our base case forecasts, partly driving our above consensus forecast for FY20 and FY21 Apple has returned roughly $300bn of cash to shareholders since 2012 through the end of F3Q18, which is roughly 30% of its current market capital, and we expect there is another roughly $300bn to deploy over the next three years. While we donâ€™t expect Apple to reach its net cash neutral position by end of FY21E, we expect share buybacks to accelerate to a $75bn annual pace (similar to 2018E) rather than the slower pace of around $30-$35bn during FY15-17â€”in part driving our above consensus forecast for FY20E and FY21E. Additionally, we are modeling a steady increase in dividends from $2.40/share in FY17 to $3.42/share in FY21E, amounting to $42bn of dividends over the next three years. 12 554 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Figure 10: Apple Share Repurchase and Dividend Forecast $ in Billions $75 $75 $74 $80 $70 Share Repurchases $70               Dividends $60 $45 $50 $35 $33 $40 $30 $23 $30 $14 $14 $14 $14 $13 $12 $12 $11 $11 $20 $10 $0        $2 FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 Source: Company reports and J.P. Morgan estimates. Acceleration in share repurchases to drive 6% accretion to our already above consensus FY20 and FY21 earnings estimates Despite our above consensus modeled pace of buybacks in FY20 and FY21, we still expect Apple to have a net cash position of $60bn by end of FY21E (and generating over $64bn of free cash annually). We see upside to our already above consensus forecasts if management decides to aggressively pursue their target for a neutral cash position. We estimate a pace of buybacks close to $100bn annually would drive the company to a cash neutral position by end of FY21E, and imply upside of $2.25 to our already above consensus FY21E EPS forecast. Balance between share purchase acceleration and M&A is likely as Apple invests to build the Services platform and maintain leadership in technology We believe it is more realistic to assume a balance between an acceleration of share repurchases beyond what is already in our base case estimates and spend on acquisitions as the drivers of earnings upside relative to our estimates. M&A Opportunities: Focus on Services with Large Installed Base Apple has historically only engaged in bolt-on acquisitions; expect focus to be on subscription-based service opportunities in the coming years Apple has a history of making multiple bolt-on acquisitions every year, which has largely been focused on bringing any hardware technology that the company expects to be crucial in driving competitive differentiation in-house and better managing its development towards commercialization. As shown in Table 1, a lot of applications in use on iPhones today can be associated with technology acquisitions in the past, for example, facial recognition using 3D sensing and speech recognition for Siri. However, as we look at the transformation of the business to Services at a rapid pace, we expect a greater bias towards acquiring subscription-based software businesses that can be integrated into the Services segment, and we believe the recent acquisitions of Shazam and Texture are typical examples of what investors should expect going forward. 13 555 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Table 1: List of Key Acquisitions Acquisition Company                  Date                                                      Business Value ($ mn) Akonia Holographics         30-Aug-18                         Lenses for augmented reality glasses Texture                     12-Mar-18                         Digital magazine subscription service Buddybuild                   2-Jan-18                         Offers tools for App development Shazam                      11-Dec-17             400         Music and Image recognition Regaind                     29-Sep-17                         Photo and facial analysis Vrvana                      22-Sep-17              30         AR headsets Lattice Data                13-May-17             200         ML to convert dark data to structured data Beddit                       9-May-17                         Monitor daily sleep habits Tuplejump                   22-Sep-16                         Big Data solutions to capture and analyze data Gliimpse                    22-Aug-16                         Personal health data recording platform Turi                         5-Aug-16             200         Help developers build scalable artificial intelligence solutions LegbaCore                    3-Feb-16                         Security consultancy â€“ firmware and software security Flyby Media                 29-Jan-16                         Augmented Reality â€“ technology for mapping spaces Emotient                     7-Jan-16                         Emotion recognition using facial data Faceshift                     Nov-15                          Motion capture platform Perceptio                     Sep-15                          Advanced artificial intelligence systems for smartphones VocalIQ                       Sep-15                          Speech technology Mapsense                      Sep-15                          Cloud-based mapping virtualization Metaio                        May-15                          Augmented Reality tools Linx                        14-Apr-15             20          Multi-aperture camera equipment for mobile devices Semetric                    21-Jan-15                         Media analytics Beats Electronics             Aug-14             3000         Subscription music service and audio devices Source: Bloomberg, Company data, and J.P.

Relative to transformational M&A driving access to new end-markets, we expect criteria to include large installed base and services opportunity We believe with increasing focus on Services revenues, particularly in the form of subscriptions, Appleâ€™s interest in entering new end-markets is likely to be evaluated based on the opportunity for Apple to offer services (leveraging the iOS platform) on a large installed base. Certain end-markets in our view could be of interest based on this criterion: 1. Video gaming companies: The video gaming industry generates about $125bn in revenues, including roughly one-third on smartphones, making it an attractive industry for smartphone manufacturers in terms of vertical integration, particularly given recent investments in augmented reality. Appleâ€™s focus on services will be highly complemented by video games, which are taking time and monetization share from other forms of entertainment. JPM Media analyst, Alexia Quadrani, believes the increasing global reach, improving technology, shift to higher-margin digital revenues, and increasingly social environments are fueling greater player engagement and spending. Software game sales are becoming increasingly digital (in the US 31% of total sales in 2010 to 74% in 2016) which is likely to coincide with the increasing computing capabilities and larger screen sizes on smartphones to drive consumer gaming habits increasingly to mobile devices. We see opportunity for smartphone-based gaming to increase from current levels of one-third of gaming revenues to around 40% of the industry by 2020, led by a double-digit annual growth rate. 2. Automotive services: Numerous press reports have in the past indicated Appleâ€™s interest in the automotive end-market, including developing an autonomous vehicle. We think Appleâ€™s interest in the automotive end-market is reasonable given the large installed base (roughly 1.4bn vehicles globally) and the ability to deliver services to drivers and passengers. We see the automotive OEM business 14 556 Samik Chatterjee, CFA                                          North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                                               27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com as a largely unattractive one both in terms of manufacturing and supply chain complexity, and profitability. Though, we would not rule out acquisitions of: a. Infotainment companies providing Apple ability to deliver content in the automotive end-market. Apple has already developed the CarPlay software to get access to the automotive end-market, but we believe owning the complete infotainment product would allow Apple to deliver the same high-quality experience that it has been able to offer consumers on other devices like the iPhone. b. Small-scale automotive OEMs to provide Apple experience in integration of software-based services with the hardware. 3. Smart Speakers: We acknowledge that Apple already has a HomePod product, which was first released in early 2018. Based on our discussion with the company, we believe Apple wants to position the HomePod as a high-quality speaker with some intelligence features, relative to: 1) Google Assistant, which is geared to intelligence leveraging the companyâ€™s leadership in search functions; and 2) Amazon Alexa, which is geared towards promoting Amazonâ€™s portfolio of features, including driving purchases in the Amazon marketplace. We believe this leaves room for Apple to position another product with greater intelligence features and with a different form factor, potentially leveraging an acquisition similar to its purchase of Beats to enter the headphone category.

Priced as of 9/25/2018. 15 557 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Appleâ€™s Opportunity in Health & Fitness Apple has already disrupted the fitness-wearables market Appleâ€™s launch of Apple Watch was relatively late when compared to early movers in the fitness-driven wearables market, including Garmin, Fitbit and Nike. However, despite being late to the market, Apple Watch managed to disrupt some of the existing players, particularly single-activity tracking devices, as well as expand the addressable market for the wearables market. While most early entrants into the wearables market were seen as functional products targeting the fitness enthusiast, we believe Apple managed to expand the addressable market with a utility product, which went beyond the niche segment of fitness enthusiasts. Now set to address health-wearables market, further expanding the target demographic to drive higher penetration We believe with the launch of features like heart rate monitoring and electro cardio grams (ECGs) in the latest generation of Apple Watches (Series 4), Apple is now making a bigger push into health-based wearables, expanding the target market beyond the typical age demographic interested in fitness wearables. For example, the target age demographic in the US now includes an additional 136mn people in the age group of 50 years and above, relative to the existing target market of 182mn in the age group below 50 years for fitness-based wearables. Move into preventive healthcare to provide a wider TAM than diagnostics We believe the preventive healthcare market is an even more attractive market than diagnostics. With its entry into health-based wearables Apple is able to target a much wider population relative to the targeted individuals in the diagnostic phase following symptom identification. For example, relative to the occurrence of AFib (Atrial Fibrilation), which the Series 4 watch can help identify, the number of people impacted in the US ranges from 2.7mn to 6.1mn and the company will be involved in the diagnostic phase with products from specialized companies like iRythm (covered by JPM Medical Supplies & Devices analyst Robbie Marcus). This compares to 182mn TAM for those aged 50 or more who are likely to adopt the Apple Watch for preventive measures and symptom identification for AFib. Multiple Re-rating from Services Transformation and Visibility into Replacement Demand Revenue acceleration likely to be a catalyst to increase investor focus on Services transformation We believe investors have largely ignored the transformation of the business towards Services. However, looking forward, we see a catalyst in the acceleration in revenue growth to a forecasted +10% CAGR from the +8% CAGR in the last five years, with further likely upside to our estimates from: 1) stronger increase in Services revenue per device; 2) stronger than expected pricing on iPhones; 3) and stronger than currently modeled growth in the Apple Watch after a major refresh with the Series 4. Boosted by an aggressive capital deployment program with repurchases totaling a forecasted $294bn for FY18E-FY21E, we expect a +17% earnings CAGR leading to our above consensus EPS forecasts. 16 558 Samik Chatterjee, CFA                                     North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                                          27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Figure 11: Total Revenues $ in Billions $400 +10% CAGR                       $340 $350 $314 $300                                                                   $289 $266 $250             +8% CAGR         $234            $229 $215 $200                      $174 $157 $161 $150 $100 FY18E FY19E FY20E FY21E FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 Source: Company reports and J.P.

Shift in composition of growth to a greater balance of Services, more than offsetting moderation in iPhone revenue growth As shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13, historically revenue growth for the company has been primarily driven by iPhone sales, but we expect more balanced growth led by iPhone sales, Services, and Other Products in the medium-term.

Apple shares have traded at a discount to the S&P 500 multiple, despite stronger revenue and earnings growth We find it largely unwarranted that AAPL shares have traded at a modest discount to the average S&P 500 multiple over the last few years despite a stronger historical track record in revenue and earnings growth, as well as stronger outlook. As shown in Figure 14, Apple shares still trade only roughly in line to at a modest discount to the S&P 500, despite a stronger revenue outlook and earnings growth outlook relative to the average company in the S&P 500. 17 559 Samik Chatterjee, CFA                               North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                                    27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Table 3: Apple vs. S&P 500 % Change Y/Y 2013        2014         2015           2016           2017        2018E     2019E    2020E    Average Revenue Growth Apple                                          3%         18%           21%             -7%              10%      13%       11%       8%             9% S&P 500                                        3%          4%           -2%              2%               7%      10%        5%       5%             4% Earnings Growth Apple                                        -23%         49%           43%           -11%               16%      31%       14%      11%             16% S&P 500                                        7%          6%           -3%             0%               13%      31%       10%      10%              9% Source: J.P.

Premium to recent year average multiple warranted on return to innovation We believe the recent year discount on Appleâ€™s trading multiple relative to the S&P 500 multiple has largely been driven by the perception that opportunities for innovative product launches into new markets have moderated since the large success of the iPhone. However, we believe Apple has now returned to demonstrating its innovation prowess, although now disrupting end-markets like wearables, health, and gaming, rather than disrupting existing hardware like it did with iPhones. In our view, the return to innovation warrants a re-rating relative to recent year average P/E multiple of 13.5x. We believe a modest re-rating is warranted based on our SOTP analysis We arrive at a blended multiple of 17.8x for the combination of Appleâ€™s products and services we anticipate in our forecast and expect a modest re-rating from current NTM trading multiple of 16.6x, led by a 14.0x multiple on the iPhone (in line with Nokiaâ€™s multiple during its leadership in feature phones) and 26.0x on Services (in line with hardline and luxury goods retailers with similar loyalty-driven recurring purchases from customers). 18 560 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Table 4: SOTP Valuation CY20 Revenue                                                  Revenue Growth EPS              P/E Multiple ($ bns)                                                      (FY17-21E) iPhone                           193             10.6                14.0x                    9% iPad                             19              0.2                 11.0x                    -2% Mac                              21              0.1                 11.0x                    -6% Services                         58              4.6                 26.0x                    23% Apple Watch                      18              0.6                 25.0x                    30% Other                            14              0.1                 16.0x                    30% Total                            323             16.2                17.8x                    10% SP500                                                                17.3x                    7% Source: J.P.

It appears there has been an increasing narrative that AAPL should be evaluated in comparison to earnings multiples for consumer staples companies, such as Household and Personal Care products with high degree of repeat purchases by consumers. We acknowledge the repeat purchase cycle for consumers in relation to the iPhone and Services group, which together currently account for 77% of total company revenues; however, the iPad, Mac, and Other products have more unpredictable replacement cycles. In addition, while the average 21x P/E multiple for Household and Personal Care (HPC) companies can be thought of as the high-end of potential re-rating for AAPL shares, we think investors should consider a discount to the average HPC multiple to account for the ability of consumers to push out smartphone purchases during a downturn in addition to trading down to less expensive variants, with only the latter likely for HPC products.

Note: Consensus estimates. Favorable Position Relative to Other Technology Leaders Comparison with other technology leaders is normal and we find Apple well positioned relative to balance of valuation multiple against earnings outlook Interestingly, with annual revenues of $230bn, Apple is ahead of other technology leaders, including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix (all covered by JPM Internet analyst Doug Anmuth). In greater contrast, Appleâ€™s $61bn in operating profit compares to $26bn for Alphabet, $20bn for Facebook, $4bn for Amazon, and $0.8bn for Netflix, showcasing a much stronger track record of generating profits than other technology leaders. While revenue and earnings growth rates for AAPL are expected to be a little less than half of the group average of Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix, so is the earnings multiple of 16.0x relative to the group average of 42.2x. As a result, we find AAPL shares screening well for both growth and value investors relative to tech leaders when looking at earnings multiple for every point of earnings growth, with PEG ratio (ex-cash) of 0.8x relative to the group average of 1.0x. 19 561 Samik Chatterjee, CFA                                       North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                                            27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Table 6: Comparison with Other Technology Leaders $ in Millions, except EPS Apple             Alphabet             Amazon              Facebook   Netflix   Average   S&P 500 FY17 Income Statement Revenue                                           $229,233            $110,855             $177,866             $40,653   $11,693 CAGR (F17-F20E)                                     11%                 12%                  25%                 27%       27%       23%        7% Operating Profit                                  $61,343             $26,146               $4,106              $20,203    $839 CAGR (F17-F20E)                                      8%                 28%                  75%                 18%       71%       48%       15% EPS                                                $9.19               $42.99               $10.10               $6.97     $1.60 CAGR (F17-F20E)                                     19%                 17%                  69%                 15%       65%       41%       17% FY19E Valuation Metrics P/E                                                 16.0x                20.9x               53.4x                17.6x    76.8x     42.2x     16.3x P/E (ex-Cash)                                       14.1x                18.5x               54.6x                16.1x    78.8x     42.0x PEG Ratio                                           0.8x                 1.2x                0.8x                 1.2x     1.2x      1.0x      2.5x PEG Ratio (ex-cash)                                 0.7x                 1.1x                0.8x                 1.1x     1.2x      1.0x EV/Sales                                            3.3x                 5.6x                3.5x                 6.5x     8.9x      6.1x FCF Yield                                            6%                   4%                  3%                   4%       NA        3% Source: J.P.

Tariff Headwinds Could Moderate Earnings Growth Expectations Currently proposed tariffs only impact accessories Apple recently sent a letter to the US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, detailing a list of products that will be impacted from the currently proposed $200bn of tariffs on imports from China. The list initially included products from the â€œOther Productsâ€ segment, which has total revenues of an estimated $26bn in FY19E, but was later updated to exclude Apple Watch which we estimate accounts for almost half of the segment revenues. We estimate Other Products excluding Apple Watch has gross margins closer to 20%. iPhones are also currently outside the purview of the proposed tariffs. We see limited impact as Apple is likely to take pricing to offset the pressures We believe it is relatively easier for Apple to raise prices on accessories relative to taking price increases on the iPhone. We expect relatively minimal price elasticity for accessory products and expect Apple to likely raise prices to cover entirely the tariffs. As shown in Table 7 below, we expect the 25% tariff to translate into a price increase of 15% if Apple decides to pass the entire impact of the tariff to consumers. 20 562 Samik Chatterjee, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                  27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com Table 7: Scenario Analysis on Currently Proposed Tariffs $ million Other Products ex Watch                                    FY19E in $ mns Revenue                                                    10,155 Gross Margin                                                  20% Gross Profit                                                2,031 COGS                                                        8,124 BOM @ 75% of COGS                                           6,093 New BOM After Tariff @ 25%                                  7,617 Scenario 1: Raise Prices to Cover Tariff Increase in Cogs on Tariff                                 1,523 Price Increase Required                                    15.0% Impact on Gross Profit                                       - Impact on Total Company Gross Margin                        0.0% Scenario 2: Raise Prices to Cover 50% of Increase Increase in COGS on Tariff                                 1,523 Price Increase Required                                     7.5% Impact on Gross Profit                                       762 New Gross Margin                                             13% Impact on Total ""Other Products"" Gross Margin               3.3% Impact on Total Company Gross Margin                        0.3% Scenario 3: Not Raise Prices Increase in COGS on Tariff                                 1,523 Impact on Gross Profit                                     1,523 New Gross Margin                                            5.0% Impact on Total ""Other Products"" Gross Margin               6.6% Impact on Total Company Gross Margin                        0.5% Source: J.P. Morgan estimates. Headwind of up to 50 bps in the worst case if Apple decides not to raise prices As shown in Scenario 3 in the table above, we estimate a headwind of up to 50 bps to total company margins if Apple decides to take a conservative approach to prices and absorb the impact, which in our view is unlikely given the even lower degree of price elasticity on accessories. No tariff impact on iPhone currently; however, we would not expect a change in sourcing strategy even with a 25% tariff Although the iPhone is not the purview of currently proposed tariffs, the greater risk to Apple would be from any potential developments relative to tariffs on the iPhone, which accounts for 60% of total company revenues. However, our analysis shows that even if a 25% tariff were to be imposed, it would still make economic sense for Apple to continue with the current manufacturing footprint relative to moving the assembly to the United States. Over the long-run, we would expect Apple to move assembly operations for the iPhone (done by Pegatron, Honhai, and Wistron) to other countries with relatively cheaper labor cost relative to the United States and not 21 563 Samik Chatterjee, CFA                                     North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798                                          27 September 2018 samik.x.chatterjee@jpmorgan.com under the purview of punitive import tariffs from the administration, for example, Mexico. See labor cost still driving enough arbitrage to keep existing manufacturing footprint rather than move to the United States As shown in Table 8, we estimate moving the assembly operations to the United States for the iPhone X would increase the cost to Apple from ~$522 to ~$643 (assuming only 50% of components are manufactured in China), relative to an estimated cost of $653 if Apple decided to pay a 25% tariff on the assembled product. In our view, the lack of any major advantage of moving assembly operations back to the United States limits the likelihood of any investment in the US as a consequence of the tariffs.

In fact, in the last 12 months ended June, 68% of smartphone shipments in EMEA and 83% of shipments in Asia Pac came with dual-SIM capabilities vs. just 4% of smartphone shipments in the US. Why the inclusion of dual-SIM support in the iPhone is important. Up until last week's product event, Apple's iPhone portfolio lacked dual-SIM support, which we believe limited demand in international markets given ~70% of iPhone shipments (on a TTM basis) were sold into regions where dual-SIM makes up more than 50% of smartphone shipments (Exhibit 1). However, with the launch of the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, Apple now has 2-3 models (depending on the region) that support dual-SIM or eSIM, which we view as an underappreciated feature of the new iPhones that has the potential to drive upside to iPhone shipments in FY19. By integrating dual-SIM into the iPhone, Apple is now on         Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with feature parity with many other smartphone vendors in international markets,         companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a creating a stronger value proposition for iPhone users to upgrade and non-          conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of iPhone owners to switch to the Apple ecosystem.                                     Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making We see the greatest potential for dual-SIM adoption in Asia Pac, and most           their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, notably, China. In the last 12 months, roughly 35% of Apple's iPhone sales were     refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this in the Asia Pacific region, where dual-SIM penetration of smartphones is >80%. In   report. 6781 China, the worlds largest smartphone market with an estimated 1.3B smartphone installed base, dual-SIM penetration is even higher at 90% (Exhibit 2). This is because most Chinese smartphone owners have 1) separate WeChat accounts for personal and professional purposes, 2) separate data plans to maximize pricing and consumption levels or 3) separate lines for domestic and international travel that makes dual-SIM a near necessity. Therefore, the lack of dual-SIM support in the iPhone has been a noticeable headwind to adoption in China, and has allowed local brands to accelerate share gains vs. Apple in recent years (Exhibit 3). When combined with an aging installed base and higher smartphone purchase intentions, dual-SIM is hitting at the optimal time. 55% of the iPhone installed base in China owns an iPhone model that is 3+ years old, compared to just 45% entering the iPhone X cycle and an average of 46% globally (Exhibit 4). Furthermore, according to our August 2018 AlphaWise survey of China smartphone owners, 86% of respondents indicate they are likely to buy a new smartphone in the next 12 months vs. 73% in the spring of 2016 (Exhibit 5), with 45% of respondents claiming they are 'extremely likely' to buy a new smartphone within the next 12 months, up from 33% last year two years ago. For the respondents that indicated intentions to upgrade, 34% said they would likely buy an iPhone, meaningfully higher than all other Chinese OEM's and higher than Appleâ€™s 27% market share today (Exhibit 6). Therefore, the combination of an aged iPhone installed base and accelerating iPhone purchase intentions among Chinese smartphone owners increases our confidence in the upgrade and switching potential in China that is underappreciated by investors, given consensus expectations for flat iPhone unit growth in FY19. Using history as a guide, Apple has the potential to accelerate share gains in China with dual-SIM integration. While there were likely a handful of factors that influenced the growing share of Chinese smartphone OEMs in the Chinese market (like camera quality, pricing, Oppo/Vivo in their early growth phase), we believe that dual-SIM integration played a meaningful role in accelerating China OEM share gains. In fact, if we look at Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi's share gains in China from the launch of their first dual-SIM enabled smartphone until dual-SIM became 80% of shipment mix, the average OEM gained 7 points of share over a period of ~3 years (Exhibit 7 & Exhibit 8). Apple currently has 10% unit share in China (on a TTM basis), up slightly from the end of 2017 (9.3%), and with the launch of dual-SIM support in the iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR in China, we believe share gains can accelerate in a similar pattern as the Chinese OEMs in the early 2010's, especially considering dual-SIM is already widely adopted by Chinese consumers (vs less than 15% of total smartphone mix early in the Chinese OEM dual-SIM adoption phase) and Apple's established brand name and strong brand loyalty in the world's largest smartphone market. 6792 Exhibits Exhibit 1: Dual SIM penetration of smartphones is greater than 50% in every market outside of North America. iPhone Units Sold and Dual SIM Penetration - Trailing 4 Quarters Dual SIM Penetration         iPhone Units 98% 100%                               90% 75%                                          68% 58% 53% 50% 35% 26% 25%                                    19%                      16% 1%                                                     3%    4% 0% India           PRC         EMEA         Rest of       Latin       North Asia/Pacific   America     America Source: IDC, Morgan Stanley Research Footnote: Rest of Asia/Pacific excludes PRC and India.

Furthermore, with higher pricing we'd expect a stronger gross margin profile for the new iPhone SKUs, especially considering the falling price of both DRAM and NAND. Net, our FY19e EPS increases to $14.69 (from $14.12) and our CY19e EPS increases to $15.35 (from $14.76). Our $247 price target is up from $245 previously, with higher revenue partially offset by recent multiple compression at internet/platform comps, most notably SNAP, TWTR, Tencent and Alibaba. We reiterate our Overweight rating and recommend buying shares on any post-event weakness due to de-risked FY19 iPhone expectations, a Services business that continues to outpace consensus expectations, and underweight allocations with large institutional investors.

Investors should consider growth, FY19 iPhone revenue growth is likely to flatline. Today's iPhone                 Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their investment decision. announcement is likely to dispel that fear. Apple's new highest end iPhone, the          For analyst certification and other important disclosures, iPhone XS Max, is $100 more expensive than last year's iPhone X, while the               refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this report. iPhone XS is in line with last year's iPhone X pricing (Exhibit 1). Additionally, each 6941 iPhone XS model is available in 64GB, 256GB and now, a 512GB SKU, meaning there is even greater uplift to average pricing on a Y/Y basis than we expected. As it relates to the iPhone XR, a starting price of $749 is $80 above our prior expectations, and while it's $50 cheaper than the iPhone 8 Plus starting price last year at launch, the general migration of higher pricing across the portfolio means that iPhone ASPs should grow Y/Y vs. our prior estimate for 2% ASP declines and street expectations for 1% ASP growth in FY19. Our new $793 iPhone ASP estimate for FY19 (+6% Y/Y) implies 65% shipment mix of the lowest storage capacity SKU, on par with mix over the last year. We then assume 25% of shipments are of the mid-level SKU and only 10% are the highest storage SKU (Exhibit 2). Expanding from two to three storage capacity options is more likely to reduce the mix of the lowest capacity, in our view, with our bull case reflecting this dynamic, implying FY19 ASPs could be up nearly 8% (Exhibit 4). (+) Integration of dual SIM a potential new demand driver, especially in China. In our view, the biggest technological upgrade in the new iPhone models that could influence unit growth is the integration of dual SIM capabilities, which will enable users to have two mobile numbers on one device. This potential catalyst is especially important in China, as it puts Apple on par with local brands in a market where the typical wireless subscriber owns more than one SIM card because many users have 1) separate WeChat accounts for personal and professional purposes, 2) separate data plans to maximize pricing and consumption levels or 3) separate phones for domestic and international travel. With 55% of the iPhone base in China owning an iPhone 6s or older (Exhibit 5), China has a more aged installed base than other regions, which combined with more users planning to upgrade their smartphone (Exhibit 6) and choose Apple relative to our past surveys (Exhibit 7), suggests dual-SIM could become a real demand driver. (=/+) iPhone technology upgrades in-line with ""S"" cycle expectations; Apple Watch moves further into Health. Most of the technological enhancements to the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR were in-line with expectations heading into the event, and the integration of iPhone X technology into a greater portion of the iPhone portfolio is a positive, in our view. Nevertheless, based on past survey work we have done, camera functionality and battery life are the most important factors to smartphone purchasers and therefore the smart HDR and improved depth control features of the new camera module (enabled by the upgraded A12 Bionic chip), plus the improved battery life vs. last years models are the most compelling upgrades, in our view (Exhibit 8). On the Apple Watch front, new technology features such as a 30% larger screen face, the S4 chip that delivers 2x the performance of the previous AW processor, and a new accelerometer are clear upgrades. However, the inclusion of advanced heart monitoring capabilities, such as rhythm detection and electrocardiogram (ECG) support, which has been cleared by the FDA, was the biggest incremental in our mind and shows that Apple continues to expand their TAM by further disrupting the healthcare market. (-) What we didn't hear that we wish we did. The iPhone and Apple Watch updates were largely in line with our expectations, however we also were hoping to hear about new iPad and/or Mac portfolio launches, especially an upgrade to the iPad Pro (including the integration of front facing 3D sensor and FaceID). Additionally, Apple made no mention of the AirPower wireless charging pad, 6952 which they introduced at last year's iPhone launch event but has been effectively unspoken of since. And while the October 26 ship date for XR is a bit later than expected, the faster geographic roll out - 59 initial countries for XS and XS Max versus 28 countries for 8 and 8 Plus a year ago - likely neutralizes any near-term unit impact. 6963"

Recent lengthening of smartphone replacement cycles driving muted FY19 iPhone unit expectations... We estimate that over the last 12-24 months, smartphone replacement cycles have elongated from ~2 years to ~3 years (Exhibit 1) as carriers have largely done away with 2-year contracts and high subsidies, and overall device quality, even from lower-end vendors, has improved. Global smartphone shipments have reinforced this fact, with the market posting unit declines in 3 consecutive quarters through June after over a decade of growth, led by the two largest smartphone markets, China and EMEA           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a (Exhibit 2 & Exhibit 3). Investors fear the trend of lengthening replacement cycles   result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a will therefore continue into 2019, resulting in low iPhone unit expectations for      conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider FY19, especially when compared to expectations for a ""supercycle"" at this time        Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making last year. Consensus currently forecasts iPhone shipment growth decelerating to       their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, +0.6% (or 220M units) in FY19, from 0.9% Y/Y growth in FY18, much lower than          refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this consensus expectations for 14% Y/Y unit growth (to 247M shipments in FY18)            report. 7261 last September. ...but we see 3 reasons why iPhone unit growth could surprise to the upside in FY19. While our current FY19 iPhone unit estimates are in-line with consensus, we see an argument that smartphone replacement cycles may lengthen at a slower pace going forward and as a result, see the potential for unit demand upside. Why? First, the smartphone has become many consumers' primary device, resulting in increased usage/wear and tear and the need to maintain near-peak performance, and as a result, we don't believe smartphone useful lives can extend much further, especially considering PC replacement cycles are currently ~4 years. Second, we estimate that 46% of the current iPhone installed base owns an iPhone 6s or older, equating to nearly 300M iPhones that are 3+ years old and in need of a technological upgrade. In China, the largest smartphone market, this ratio is even higher at 55%. While this doesn't necessarily mean these iPhone users will upgrade their iPhone, this base of aged iPhones is larger than ahead of last year's cycle (Exhibit 4). In fact, our August 2018 AlphaWise survey of 2000 Chinese consumers shows a meaningful increase in the percentage of respondents that are likely to buy a new smartphone in the next 12 months - 86% vs. 73% in our last China AlphaWise survey (Exhibit 5), with the majority of those respondents likely to purchase an iPhone (Exhibit 6). Lastly, we believe that integrating wireless charging, edge-to-edge displays, and front-facing 3D sensing/Face ID across a wider range of the iPhone portfolio, from the plus size high-end 6.5"" OLED iPhone down to the ""lower-end"" 6.1"" LCD iPhone, provides greater incentive for users to upgrade their phone over the next year vs. the current iPhone X / 8 cycle. Expectations rising for iPhone ASP growth in FY19. With iPhone ASPs expected to grow 15% Y/Y in FY18, investors are concerned that ASPs could decline in FY19, especially with the launch of the ""lower-end"" 6.1"" LCD iPhone. Earlier this year, we published our early views that FY19 iPhone ASP growth is likely to vary from -2% to +2%, largely dependent on the price of the LCD iPhone. We currently model iPhone ASPs down 2% Y/Y in FY19, which reflects a scenario where Apple prices the 6.5"" OLED model at $999, the 5.8"" OLED model at $899 and the 6.1'' LCD model at $669 (Exhibit 7), while consensus models ASPs up 1%. Based on management commentary and Apple's pricing track record, we believe both forecasts could be low. On Apple's F2Q18 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said, ""we price [iPhones] for the value that we're delivering"", suggesting to us the new iPhone line-up will remain priced at or above previous iPhones. And since the iPhone X has been the best selling iPhone this year, despite the $999 starting price tag, we believe Apple understands consumers are willing to pay for a superior device and user experience. Therefore, we believe Apple could price the LCD model between $699 and $799 (our bull case) and the larger screen OLED model slightly above $999, which would result in iPhone ASPs growing somewhere between the high-end of our base case (+2% Y/Y) and our bull case (+7% Y/Y; Exhibit 8). Expect little near-term stock reaction to the event; but we continue to see outperformance longer-term. Despite the outperformance of shares since Apple reported June quarter earnings (AAPL +17% vs. S&P +3%), we continue to believe that Apple shares are undervalued and maintain our Overweight thesis going into next week's event. However, the September iPhone launch has rarely been a short term catalyst for the stock, as the median absolute and relative (to the 7272 S&P) stock performance in the day of the event is -0.6% and -0.5%, respectively, over the last 10 years. Furthermore, with institutional investor positioning inching 20bps higher (Q/Q) in the June quarter, and likely further in the Sept quarter, the September 12th launch could serve as a ""sell the news"" event for shorter-term investors. Nevertheless, with de-risked FY19 iPhone expectations (implying a potential path to positive EPS revisions) and a Services business that continues to outpace consensus expectations and will account for more than 60% of revenue growth over the next five years (see our recent Services deep dives: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3), we'd recommend buying shares ahead of the event or on any post-event weakness, as the median absolute and relative stock performance 6 months following an iPhone launch is 26.5% and 9.9%, respectively (Exhibit 9). 7283"

Video as a $4B+ stand-alone business. Our analysis assumes Apple focuses on fewer, more targeted content than other video platforms that target a more complete replacement of cable subscriptions. On a stand-alone basis, we forecast that an Apple Video streaming service with high quality but limited breadth could be priced at the low end vs. competitors, or $7.99/month, and reach over 50M paid subscribers by 2025, compared to 124M at Netflix (current Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with paid streaming subs) and Apple's >650M unit iPhone installed base.

To bundle or not to bundle? Hedging narrow video catalog with other music and news. As a stand-alone business, Apple's original content video service may lack a catalog of dated non-original content to complement its original content in production, making the stand-alone service less robust than peer video on- demand services and more reliant on big hits. As a result, we believe a bundling of Apple's video content with Apple Music and the Texture news and magazine subscription service into a $12.99/month unlimited ""Apple Media' service (in-line with the current cost of a Hulu and Spotify bundle) would make the most sense for 5 primary reasons: 1) it would allow for differentiation vs. established peers, 2) it would reduce dependency on big video hits early on, 3) it could be perceived as a ""higher value"" service by consumers, 4) users would only need to navigate one integrated payments platform for all of their video, music, and news services, and 5) it could drive greater user engagement, subsequently improving overall customer stickiness. Apple Media bundle could become a $37B revenue business by 2025, 64% higher than if Apple Music and Apple Video were offered as stand-alone services. From a financial perspective, we believe there is clear reasoning as to why Apple would pursue the Apple Media bundle. However, we believe the most likely option will be a combination of both - i.e. offer Apple Video as a $7.99/month stand-alone option but also offer the Apple Media bundle for $12.99/month. While we'd still expect the majority of users to sign-up for the bundled product (given the strong value proposition), it would be unrealistic to think there wouldn't be a cohort of consumers attracted only to a specific Apple Video offering, which would make the stand-alone video service the more ideal option for some. Regardless, this implies the combined Apple Music & Apple Video product could reach anywhere between $22-37B in revenue by 2025, up from an estimated $4B this year. We see Apple Media contributing 2 points of Apple Services growth through CY25. If we incorporate the assumptions from our Apple Media bundle scenario while keeping all other Apple Services forecasts unchanged, then we'd expect Apple Services revenue to grow at a 21% CAGR through CY25, ultimately reaching $143B by 2025, up from current forecasts of a 19% revenue CAGR and $124B in revenue by 2025 (Exhibit 1). In this scenario, Apple Media, along with Software and Other and the App Store would each contribute about â…“ of Apple's total Services revenue growth through 2025. We estimate that total Apple Services operating margins with Apple Media would be ~500bps lower than our current forecasts with just Apple Music through CY25 (Exhibit 2). However, because our current Apple Music and hypothetical Apple Media operating margin forecasts both imply low single digit percentage operating losses each year, the medium-term impact (through CY21) to Apple Services operating income is negligible (Exhibit 3). Longer term however, we see streaming music, original video content and news collectively as a more important profit generator for Apple, with the Apple Media bundle generating over $2.4B in operating income by 2025 vs. just $1B in our current Apple Music forecast. Keeping our estimates unchanged for now; but upward bias emphasizes services multiple re-rating, with peer multiple expansion driving our PT to $245 (from 7622 $232). It had been long rumored that Apple would acquire a media studio to jump-start its content efforts. It now appears, however, given the announcements in the last 12 months, that Apple is more focused on building these efforts in-house. Nevertheless, it's still very early days in this business, with the first round of programming not expected to be released until Spring 2019. Therefore we do not make any adjustments to our Apple forecasts at this time, nor do we assign any value to the incremental video opportunity, which we estimate is potentially worth $20/share. Instead, we await further clarity on how Apple plans to distribute its video content including pricing model and breadth of content offered. Nevertheless, we believe that Apple Video will become a reality sooner than investors think, and use this report as a way to frame the two most likely methods for video content distribution and potential impact video could have on Apple's Services business. Optionality around Apple Video helps emphasize the increasing contribution to growth from Services. Even before incorporating a full Apple Media bundle, our current forecasts imply Services drives 62% of revenue and 90% of EBIT growth over the next five years. Recent multiple expansion at Services peers, namely NFLX, TWTR and AMZN, drive our SOTP-based price target to $245 which reflects a 16.6x CY19 P/E and 3.6x CY19 EV/Sales multiple (Exhibit 4).

While iTunes originally launched as a music platform in 2001, Apple added video content - originally just six short films from Pixar Animation Studios and a small handful of TV series (such as Lost and Desperate Housewives) - to the platform in October 2005 with the launch of iTunes 6. Since then, Apple added TV series and movie rentals, and by October 2008 passed 2M feature-length films and 200M TV episodes sold. However, the launch of streaming video services from the likes of Netflix, Hulu, and HBO have been formidable headwinds to the iTunes video business, reducing iTunes share of the movie rental and sales market to less than 35%, from over 50% in 2012. At the same time, both traditional networks (premium, broadcast and basic cable) and newer age content providers like Netflix, YouTube, and Facebook have made significant investments in original programming, with hit series such as Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and House of Cards becoming household names and propelling stocks like Netflix to gain >900% in the last five years. As early as 2015, media reports emerged claiming Apple was trying to break into the original programming business, with Apple Software and Services head Eddy Cue spearheading the effort. In mid-2017, Apple hired Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, former Sony Pictures executives credited with developing shows like Breaking Bad and Shark Tank, as the global heads of video programming.

Content includes 6 short films from Pixar and a small handful of TV series such as Lost and Desperate Housewives Source: Company Data, Deadline, Variety, Morgan Stanley Research Entering a crowded market. At the same time Apple hired Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, it launched its first two original series, Planet of the Apps (in June 2017) and Carpool Karaoke (in August 2017), which both debuted to lukewarm receptions. After all, the market for original content acquisition is fiercely competitive, with both old media and new tech companies doling out tens of billions of dollars (cumulatively) to acquire original content outside the reach of Apple's nascent programming business. 7666 Nevertheless, with over $260B of gross cash at the time, Apple meaningfully upped the stakes in August 2017, with the WSJ reporting Apple set a budget of $1B to procure and produce original content in 2018. Combined with a device installed base of over 1.3B and a footprint in over 100 countries, Apple has suddenly become a potential threat to incumbent players. However, on a relative basis, Apples $1B in spend is dwarfed by many of the major networks and streaming services, who have announced content spend (excluding sports programming) 2-10x Apple's budget in 2018 (Exhibit 7). Exhibit 7: Apple's $1B original programming budget is meaningful, but still dwarfed by many of the traditional broadcast companies, as well as YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Source: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research What will Apple do with its $1B content budget? In October 2017 it was reported Apple ordered a re-boot of the 1980's sci-fi series Amazing Stories, executive produced and created by Hollywood icon Steven Spielberg. Over the following 6 months, media outlets reported Apple made 11 additional original content orders (mostly TV series), featuring actresses Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and executive producers Damien Chazelle and M. Night Shyamalan (Exhibit 8). The pace of Apple's original content announcements accelerated in June, with Deadline and Variety reporting 12 new original programming orders from Apple in the between May 20th and August 21st, spearheaded by a major multi-year partnership announcement between Apple and Oprah Winfrey (Exhibit 9). While it's unknown exactly how much Apple has and will spend on these 24 programs (many are straight to series orders), we estimate that cumulative costs thus far have surpassed $800M at the minimum, using $2M/episode as a baseline for a comedy series, $5M/episode for a drama series, and $10M for a high-end series. The New York Times estimates that Apple will launch its slate of original programming in 2019, and also noted that the company will ""blow well past that [$1B] figure"" for total content costs. 7677"

This morning, TechCrunch reported that Netflix is currently testing (in 33 countries, excluding the US) having new or lapsed subscribers input their payment method directly into Netflix through a mobile web version of the service, thereby bypassing the App Store on iOS devices. In a worst case scenario, this would imply that Apple would no longer take a 15-30% cut of all NFLX related International revenue captured in the App Store. According to Sensor Tower estimates, we believe Entertainment-related app purchases account for ~6% of App Store net revenue and 2% of Apple Services revenue on a T12M basis. However, itâ€™s important to note that China, where NFLX is not available, accounts for 40% of total Entertainment spend on the App Store. Therefore, if we realistically assume that NFLX makes up half of the remaining 60% of Entertainment-related App Store purchases and that only international markets, which account for about half of spend ex-China, bypass the App Store (NFLX reportedly not testing this in the US) then the net revenue impact to the App Store on a T12M basis would be 80bps, and about 30bps for all of Apple Services, with an immaterial impact to total Apple revenue. And despite the margin profile of the App Store being meaningfully higher than company average, we estimate the gross profit dollar impact at a company level would be a mere 6bps. Therefore, we believe the revenue and profit impact on the App Store and Apple more broadly is manageable in the event NFLX eventually decided to entirely bypass payments via the App Store. More concerning would be if other services followed suit, however we view this threat as unlikely, given services/developers value the App Store for greater exposure to high quality consumers and users value the App Store for frictionless purchasing across services.

Our $232 SOTP-driven price target is unchanged after raising our revenue forecast modestly, shifting to CY19, and considering recent multiple compression at Services peers (Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba). What we learned from Apple's F3Q18 earnings: (+) Services narrative gains momentum with references to strong pipeline of new services. Services revenue grew 31% Y/Y, above consensus expectations of 26% Y/Y and more in-line with our 32% Y/Y forecast. However, backing out a $236M one-time legal benefit implies 28% Y/Y normalized growth. In the June quarter, paid subscriptions to Apple Services topped 300M users (+60% Y/Y) and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay all set new June quarterly revenue records. For the App Store, results were even more impressive when considering the Chinese government reportedly slowed the process of new app approvals in the quarter (China is biggest App Store country        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a in the world), although approvals appear to be accelerating in recent weeks.           result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a Importantly, management expressed enthusiasm for upcoming ""new"" Services               conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research.

(+) Other Products contribution growing with success of AirPods and Watch. 17 1 Other Products grew 37% Y/Y in the June quarter, in-line with growth in the last 3 quarters, accounting for 13% of Apple's Y/Y revenue growth. Apple Watch on its own grew mid-40% Y/Y while Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products together grew 60% Y/Y. It is becoming increasingly clear that users view these products as important complements to their iPhone, and we believe they are successfully broadening the Apple ecosystem and increasing customer stickiness (and spend) to the platform. With WatchOS 5 launching to the public this fall plus the expectation for an update to the AirPods by year end, we see Other Products continuing to grow at a strong double digit rate over a multi-year period. (+) Guidance better on broad-based growth and upcoming product cycle. September quarter revenue guidance of $60-62B was 5% higher than our pre- earnings estimate and 2% higher than consensus coming into the quarter. Importantly, this signals that iPhone, Wearables and Services are expected to continue growing at a strong double digit pace to close out FY18. We increase our Sept Q iPhone shipment estimate to 48.3M units (+3% Y/Y) and increase iPhone ASPs to $720, which would imply largely flat ASPs Q/Q, below historical seasonality of low single digit Q/Q ASP increases. We also model Sept Q Services growth of 18% Y/Y, which represents 28% Y/Y normalized growth when backing out the $640M favorable one-timer from F4Q17 results. Net, our Sept Q revenue estimate increases to $61.0B (from $58.2B prior). With flat gross margin and seasonal OpEx growth, our FY4Q EPS increases to $2.75, from $2.61 previously. (+/-) Gross margins only in-line despite NAND and Services tailwinds. We picked up a fair amount of investor excitement into the quarter around potential gross margin upside as NAND prices fall. However, the impact is somewhat delayed due to inventory of higher priced NAND on Apple's balance sheet, which came down by $1.7B in June. Looking forward, we see potential upside from falling NAND prices (NAND was a 60bps Y/Y headwind to GM in June but flat Q/Q) but a 30bps FX headwind will offset some of this upside in September. Importantly, a stable gross margin outlook puts to rest any concerns that Apple will meaningfully change its iPhone pricing strategy to chase unit demand in the upcoming iPhone product cycle. 18 2 Exhibits Exhibit 1: While Apple balance sheet inventory fell, the combination of Apple Inventory and Vendor Non-Trade Receivables reached $18.2B in the June quarter, up 36% Y/Y.

We currently see no delay in the     e = Morgan Stanley Research estimates, a = Actual Company reported data ramp of Apple's upcoming flagship 5.8"" or 6.5"" OLED iPhones, however suspected issues with LED backlight leakage have caused a 1 month delay in mass production of the 6.1"" LCD iPhone, although this is down from a 6 week delay baked into the original production forecast, according to suppliers. Nevertheless, all three new iPhone models are expected to be announced in September, with our Greater China Technology Hardware team still forecasting 90M new iPhone builds in C2H18, up slightly from 89M in C2H17. We make minor adjustments to June quarter estimates (iPhone units up 800k, Mac units up 150k, iPad units down 500k, Services growth to 32% Y/Y, from 33%) but otherwise keep our FY18 and FY19 device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) forecasts unchanged, while slightly tweaking Services growth on the margin (Exhibit 1 & Exhibit 2). Net, we now model FY18e EPS of $11.45 (up from $11.41 prior) and FY19e EPS of $14.00 (up from $13.76 prior). With the summer months typically viewed as a product transition period, we look to the September launch of the new iPhone models as the next meaningful stock catalyst but note that 1) a push out of the iPhone launch date,     Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a 2) meaningfully weaker Services data points, or 3) increasingly heated trade         result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a rhetoric between the US and China present the greatest risks to shares over the      conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider next 3 months.                                                                       Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their investment decision. We expect Services results to be the focal point of June quarter report with         For analyst certification and other important disclosures, results outpacing consensus. Given iPhone results matter less late in a cycle and    refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this consensus expects flattish iPhone growth going forward as the market matures,        report. 75 1 we expect investors to focus increasingly on Services results as a sign of whether Apple's installed base monetization efforts can drive overall company growth despite declining device revenue. As we wrote about last week, we believe Apple's Services story continued to play out in June, with App Store growth consistent vs. C1Q at 27% Y/Y (Exhibit 3) and Apple Music paid subscribers hitting our quarter end target, implying over 70% Y/Y paid subscriber growth in the quarter (Exhibit 4). While insight into other Services line items is limited, we model June quarter Services growth of 32% (or $9.6B), a 1 point acceleration from March results, meaningfully above the consensus forecast of $9.2B (+26% Y/Y), which implies a 5 point deceleration in growth from March (Exhibit 5). As we look ahead, keep in mind that the September 2017 quarter had a $640M one- time favorable adjustment, therefore our forecast for 23% Y/Y Services growth implies 33% Y/Y growth when backing out the one time positive adjustment last year. June iPhone results tracking in-line; see slight downside risk to Sept consensus ests. Our AlphaWise iPhone tracker, which compiles sell-through data using web search analytics, currently points to sell out of 43.8M units (-1% Y/Y) in the June quarter (Exhibit 6). However, the June quarter typically represents the peak period of channel inventory reduction ahead of new model restocking, and we are therefore forecasting a 4M Q/Q channel inventory reduction, in-line with the iPhone 6s cycle (Exhibit 7). As a result, we now model June quarter iPhone shipments of 39.8M units (-3% Y/Y; Exhibit 8), 800k units above our previous estimate of 39M but 5% below consensus of 41.8M units. Along with the rest of our minor June quarter adjustments, we now forecast revenue of $51.9B, a gross margin of 38.3% and EPS of $2.17, which compares to consensus of $52.3B, 38.3% and $2.18, respectively. As we look to the September quarter, we forecast 46M iPhone shipments (-1% Y/Y), below consensus estimates of 47.1M, due in part to the possibly later launch of the 6.1"" LCD iPhone. However, with component cost compares easing and higher margin Services becoming a greater mix of revenue (18% vs. 16% in F4Q17), we see a lower seasonal drop in gross margins in the September quarter (-16bps vs. 5 year trailing avg. of -32bps). Altogether, we model September quarter revenue, gross margin and EPS of $58.2B, 38.2% and $2.61 vs. consensus of $59.5B, 38.1% and $2.65, respectively. Apple inventory dynamics making it tougher to tie iPhone supply chain data points to shipments. Historically, June quarter iPhone shipments have tied closely to iPhone builds (trailing 5 year avg. difference of +34bps; Exhibit 9) but we believe this relationship is weakening, primarily due to growing Apple balance sheet inventory. At March quarter end, Apple's B/S inventory was $7.7B, up 73%, or $3.2B, from the December quarter and 58% ($2.8B) from FY17 year-end. Digging further, finished goods inventory at March quarter end grew 35% vs. FY17 year-end while component inventory grew 71% (Exhibit 10). As a result, we believe weaker Apple supplier data points tie as much to inventory digestion as to demand trends. Quant work aligns with our fundamental view of potential modest downside to September outlook, but inventory position may skew the picture. Over the last 6 months, we have worked with our Morgan Stanley quant team to consolidate data on a larger number (50-60) of Taiwanese Apple suppliers, and systematically explore the correlations or statistical inferences that can help shape our views on Apple's revenue guidance. Ahead of March quarter earnings, 76 2 this quant work successfully predicted an in-line guide, which was more bullish than our below-consensus fundamental expectations. In the June quarter, these supply chain companies had a strong April and May, but a weaker June, especially a subset of 12 suppliers (a third of which are ODMs) that have been identified as having a higher correlation to Apple sales guidance and stock performance than others. For this subset of companies, when Y/Y sales growth decelerates, Apple's one quarter forward guidance typically comes in below consensus. This quarter, sales growth for these companies decelerated by 600bps vs. March quarter results, therefore we see modest downside risk to September guidance vs. consensus, in line with our fundamental view (Exhibit 11). However, 1) Apple's inventory dynamic discussed above, 2) a later production launch a year ago impacting Y/Y comps, and 3) a 1 month delay in the 6.1"" LCD iPhone ramp are factors that could weaken the relationship this quarter. Remain Overweight as market still undervalues increasingly important Services story; PT increases to $232 (from $214) as we mark our SOTP-based PT to market. Two months ago we introduced our SOTP-based price target frame work for Apple, where we value Apple's Hardware/Device business (82% of FY19 revenue) using a blend of an HPQ and MSFT EV / Sales multiple, and the Services business (18% of FY19 revenue) using the median of 10 internet/services/platform EV / Sales multiples. With the average internet/platform comp up 16% since May 1 (and MSFT up 12%), we've seen a meaningful re-rating of peer multiples, which subsequently increases our SOTP-driven price target for Apple to $232, from $214 (Exhibit 12). At $232, Apple trades at a 3.5x EV / 2019E Sales multiple and a 16.6x P/E on FY19E EPS, slightly less than one turn above Apple's 10-year historical average P/E multiple of 15.8x. However, with Services increasingly becoming a more important driver of both revenue and gross profit dollar growth (we estimate Services will account for 27% of Apple revenue and just under 40% of gross profit dollars by FY22), plus the fact that Apple has a larger and more accessible cash balance today, we believe this premium valuation is warranted. And as Services growth continues to stand out, we believe investors will begin to recognize this fundamental shift in company structure re-rating shares higher. 77 3 Exhibits Exhibit 1: Apple Estimate Changes (Quarterly) Apple (AAPL)                                   Jun '18 Qtr                               Sept '18 Qtr                     Dec '18 Qtr (USD in Millions)                       MS-New MS-Old                  Cons       MS-New MS-Old         Cons       MS-New MS-Old          Cons Total Revenue                                  $51,941   $51,622             $52,319     $58,229   $58,196    $59,549     $86,936   $86,903     $91,039 Y/Y Growth                                      14.4%     13.7%               15.2%       10.7%     10.7%      13.3%       -1.5%      -1.6%       3.1% Gross Margin                                     38.3%      38.3%              32.3%       38.2%      38.2%     38.1%       38.2%      38.2%      38.5% EPS                                              $2.17      $2.15              $2.18       $2.61      $2.60     $2.65       $4.56      $4.52      $4.73 Y/Y Growth                                      30.5%     29.0%               30.9%       26.3%     25.8%      28.3%       17.3%     16.3%       21.6% Diluted Share Count (M)                        4,935.3   4,948.9                         4,831.0    4,844.5               4,729.2   4,742.7 iPhone Revenue                                  $28,166          $27,616     $28,937    $32,129    $32,127    $33,141    $57,349     $57,347    $60,469 iPhone Units (M)                                  39,800           39,000      41,806     46,000     46,000     47,075     75,000      75,000     77,417 iPhone ASP                                         $702             $702        $692       $695       $695       $704       $770        $770       $781 iPad Revenue                                     $4,708            $4,927     $4,604     $4,726     $4,726     $4,341      $5,599     $5,600     $5,694 iPad Units (M)                                    10,500            11,000     10,288     10,000     10,000      9,610      12,500     12,500     12,788 iPad ASP                                           $454              $454       $447       $477       $477       $452        $455       $455       $445 Mac Revenue                                      $5,712            $5,534     $5,847     $6,599     $6,598     $7,032      $6,433     $6,433     $6,979 Mac Units (M)                                      4,301             4,163      4,270      4,955      4,955      5,168       4,856      4,856      5,146 Mac ASP                                          $1,321            $1,321     $1,369     $1,330     $1,330     $1,361      $1,333     $1,333     $1,356 Wearables / Accessories                          $3,728            $3,880     $3,749     $4,288     $4,288     NA          $6,680     $6,680     NA Y/Y Growth                                        36%               42%        37%        33%        33%                    22%        22% Services                                         $9,627            $9,664     $9,183    $10,488    $10,456     NA        $10,875     $10,843     NA Y/Y Growth                                        32%               33%        26%        23%        23%                   28%         28% MSe vs Cons Total Revenue                                      -0.7%                                   -2.2%                            -4.5% EPS                                                -0.3%                                   -1.5%                            -3.6% Source: Company Data, Thomson Reuters, FactSet, Morgan Stanley Research 78 4"

App Store accounts for 36% of Apple Services revenue over the last twelve months and is strongly correlated (0.98) with reported Apple Services revenue. China growth continues to decelerate but US and other countries provide offset. China, US and Japan remained the 3 largest App Store revenue generators in C2Q18, accounting for 76% of total App Store net revenue, slightly below the T12M average of 77%. App Store growth in China decelerated 400bps to 25% Y/Y (Exhibit 4) as did growth in Japan (+11% Y/Y), however growth in the US accelerated over 800bps to 36% Y/Y (Exhibit 5). Growth for all other countries accelerated 100bps to 36% Y/Y, with the top 10 countries ex-China, US and Japan (by revenue generation) accelerating to the fastest quarterly growth rate in over 3 years (Exhibit 7). As we hypothesized in our App Store deep dive published in May, while China, the US and Japan will collectively remain the ballasts for App Store growth, other smaller but faster growing countries will continue to           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

China, USA and Japan growing their contribution by 200bps, to 14%, from C1Q18       For analyst certification and other important disclosures, refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this (Exhibit 9).                                                                        report. 1061 Mixed results in gaming. Gaming related app downloads and in-app purchases continue to drive the majority of App Store revenue, accounting for 72% of App Store net revenue and contributing close to half of App Store Y/Y revenue growth. Globally, gaming app net revenue grew 15% Y/Y in C2Q18, flat vs. C1Q18 (Exhibit 10). However, within this result the US was extremely strong - likely on the heels of the successful Fortnite launch in late March, which brought in more than $100M in gross spend on iOS in its 3 months on the App Store - offset by a weaker China. US gaming growth accelerated 900bps from the prior quarter to 20% Y/Y (Exhibit 12) while China gaming-related revenue decelerated ~300bps to 15% Y/Y growth (Exhibit 11). We attribute weaker China gaming revenues to 1) the growing importance of entertainment apps (such as short form videos), the second largest revenue generating app category in China, where revenue grew 164% Y/Y in C2Q18 (from 141% Y/Y growth in C1Q18) and 2) the growing importance of mini-programs in apps such as WeChat which provide an alternative to Apple or Google app store content. Overall, our Services thesis remains intact; Remain OW with $214 SOTP-driven PT. While C2Q18 App Store net revenue fell slightly short of our estimate, it implies upside to consensus Services growth forecast and points to diversifying growth drivers outside of China. We believe Services revenue can surprise positively both in the near and long-term with a still growing iPhone installed base, increasing mobile engagement, growing mobile spend and the proliferation of new smartphone technology like 3D sensors that will usher in a new genre of apps focused on augmented reality. And while we recognize threats to the App Store exist, such as the growth in WeChat's mini-programs in China, we believe diversifying growth drivers suggest recent growth rates are indeed sustainable, and forecast App Store net revenue growing at a 26.1% CAGR through 2021 (down slightly from 26.4% prior). From a bigger picture standpoint, given the strong C2Q18 results from the App Store, and only slight deviation from our above consensus Services forecast, we keep our C2Q18 Apple Services revenue estimate of $9.66B (+33% Y/Y) unchanged and look to C2Q results announced on July 31st as the next signpost to determine whether our thesis - which calls for Services to become Apple's primary growth driver over the next 5 years - is playing out as expected (see here for a more in-depth report on our bullish Services call). Note, Sensor Tower updates their Store Intelligence dataset 3-4 times per year as they accumulate new publisher and developer data points over time. On a country or store level, these updates result in revisions that are rarely more than low- single-digit percentage point changes in either direction. In this latest update, cumulative App Store payments to developers between 1Q14 and 1Q18 increased by $65M (+8bps), resulting in historical App Store net revenue growth rates that slightly differ from our previously published estimates.

Similar to last year, we view the iOS 12 updates to both AR functionality and AI/ML integration as the key announcements of the day. For AR, Apple released ARKit 2.0, the augmented reality toolkit for app developers, which now offers improved face tracking, more realistic image rendering, 3D object detection and, most notably, the ability to create a shared multi- player/device AR experience. Apple also introduced tongue detection and the ability to customize your own lookalike Animoji, called MeMoji, which we see as a direct shot at Snapchat's popular Bitmoji tool. On the AI side, Apple's newest feature is called Shortcuts, which allows users to create action-based commands to automate tasks based on your schedule, location, recent contacts, etc. - all        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a communicated through the Siri digital assistant. Users also have the ability to        result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a customize and create new shortcuts and proactive suggestions that allow for the        conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research.

With full integration available on the iPhone, iPad, HomePod and          For analyst certification and other important disclosures, refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this Apple Watch, we believe this brings Siri one encouraging step closer to                report. 1561 competing with the likes of Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant. Other notable software updates: Presumably in response to feedback from large shareholders earlier this year, Apple introduced a suite of features and alerts that will allow for parents to better control their children's phone usage, named Screen Time. With iOS 12, parents can set allowances for phone usage, control when their children use certain apps, limit access to parts of the iPhone and digest a weekly summary on usage trends. For watchOS, highlights included new health & fitness features (such as peer-to-peer competitions), 3rd party app connectivity on your Apple Watch face, a new communication tool named ""Walkie Talkie"", the ability to view condensed web content, and the ability to listen to Podcasts. Lastly, Apple SVP of Software Craig Federighi stated that Apple will not be merging iOS and macOS (latest update named macOS Mojave) but that they have started to integrate developer frameworks from iOS into macOS. As of today, the only apps that have cross-platform functionality are News, Stocks, Voice Memo and Home, with the tools to allow for such functionality coming to developers next year. Lastly, regarding privacy, Apple built on last year's Safari ad tracker blocker with further enhancements to limit the ability of third party websites (like Facebook) to track user searches and limit the amount of data third-parties can collect on users. Apple did not provide any hardware updates today. At last year's WWDC, Apple announced the introduction of the HomePod smart speaker, a new 10.5"" iPad Pro, and updates to the Mac and Macbook product lines. This year, Apple chose not to announce any hardware updates, instead focusing solely on software and services. Therefore, any announcements regarding the AirPower, an updated iPad Pro and/or an iPhone SE 2 will likely come this fall. Why this is important from an investor standpoint. As we've highlighted multiple times in the past, Apple's vertical integration allows them to have total control over the user experience that other hardware vendors simply cannot match. As a result, consumers (and developers) are drawn to Apple's broad ecosystem of devices and services. Today's software announcements only strengthen Apple's ecosystem, allowing for unique user experiences (such as AR functionality), enhancements to capabilities where Apple has been admittedly behind (such as AI integration) and unparalleled services (such as the App Store) that cannot be replicated, in totality, by any other hardware vendor. As a result, we continue to believe that Apple is the world's most valuable technology platform with 1.3B active devices and customers that are highly engaged, loyal and spending growing amounts on Services over time. Apple shares currently trade at 13.9x our FY19 EPS of $13.76 (or 11.9x ex-cash), a ~1-turn premium to our IT hardware group but below Apple's 10-year average P/E of 15.8x, which undervalues the growing Services contribution, in our view. Our unchanged, SOTP-driven $214 price target implies shares trade at a 15.5x target P/E multiple, and we see accelerating Services data points, such as the ones announced today, as catalysts to help shares re-rate higher. 1572"

We are using this follow-up to our March 2018 Apple Services deep dive to explore the largest business within Services, the App Store, which we estimate already accounts for nearly 40% of total Services revenue and is the greatest contributor to Services revenue growth. Why focus first on the App Store? Two reasons. First, the App Store is the largest and most significant contributor to Services growth. We estimate the correlation between Apple Services revenue and App Store net revenue (i.e. what is recognized on Apple's P&L) is 0.98, with an r-squared of 0.96 (Exhibit 2), implying Services revenue is directly linked to the performance of the App Store. Second, Apple is notoriously reticent when it comes to Services data points, and     Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a the App Store is one of the only Services segments where there is detailed third     result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a party data available to analyze. As a result, we have a better understanding of      conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider the underlying trends in the App Store and believe it will be key to determining     Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making Apple Services performance in the near to medium term.                               their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, In this note we address the four key debates in detail. We've increasingly heard     refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this report. pushback from investors on four key Services debates: 1) Is App Store growth 2131 sustainable? 2) Are App Store take rates defensible? 3) Are we at or near peak Services margins? 4) What is the right multiple to use to value Apple? In short, we disagree with bears and believe that the App Store, and Services more broadly, holds the key to Apple's future. A $40B business growing at 25%+. We estimate that in the last 12 months, users have spent over $40B in the App Store, of which Apple collects roughly a 30% cut, implying the App Store generated slightly more than $12B of net revenue for Apple in the last 12 months, up 29% Y/Y. From a category perspective, games and gaming-related apps represent only 30% of downloads but represent close to 75% of App Store revenue, making it the most significant driver of App Store growth. From a country perspective, China, the USA, and Japan make up 77% of App Store revenue and accounted for ~80-90% of App Store revenue growth over the past three years. Due to their sheer size, these countries remain important to future growth; however, we estimate that all other regions are growing nearly 40% Y/Y and contributed almost twice as much towards revenue growth in C1Q18 as in the year prior. With diversifying growth drivers, we belive the App Store has significant growth runway ahead and we forecast it growing at a 26% revenue CAGR through 2021. Dispelling the Services negative mix shift narrative. We've increasingly heard from investors that the fastest growing but lowest margin businesses within Apple Services, such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay, will drive negative mix shift away from higher margin, more established businesses like the App Store, such that Services margins are close to peak levels. We disagree. Yes, some of the more nascent, structurally lower margin Services businesses are growing an estimated 50%+, almost twice the rate of the App Store. But the App Store is growing off a much larger revenue base, at $12B, and therefore contributes the largest portion of incremental growth going forward. With App Store generating the second highest operating margin within Services, we forecast Services margins expanding 500 bps through 2021, with the App Store accounting for 45% of Services operating profit growth over the next five years. Investors need to recognize the fundamental shift in structure. We believe that Apple is a structurally different company today than it was just five years ago, with a larger (and more accessible) cash balance and a Services business that accounts for roughly 15% of revenue and 22% of gross profit dollars this year vs. 9% of revenue and 10% of gross profit dollars just five years ago. By FY22, we believe Services will account for 27% of Apple revenue and just under 40% of gross profit dollars. As a result, we believe that the Services business is being undervalued by investors that use hardware-based P/E or EV/EBITDA multiple valuation to derive their price targets. In this context, we shift our valuation to SOTP-based; PT increases to $214 (from $200). In our updated SOTP analysis (Exhibit 3), we value the Hardware/Device business using a blend of an HPQ and Microsoft EV / Sales multiple, while for Services we use the median of 10 internet/services/platform EV / Sales multiples. This results in our new price target of $214, up from $200 prior, for 14% upside from current levels. On a P/E basis, our new SOTP valuation implies Apple trades at a 15.5x P/E multiple on our unchanged FY19 EPS of $13.76, which is 1 turn above our prior target multiple of 14.5x but below Apple's 10-year average P/E multiple of 15.8x. On an industry comparable basis, our new price target of $214 implies Apple trades at a 3-turn premium to our IT Hardware 2142 group, a slight discount to US Consumer Staples peers and at a significant discount to Software and Internet peers.

At the same time, the App Store mix of Services revenue has grown nearly 10 points, and now accounts for an estimated 37% of Services revenue (Exhibit 5), implying the App Store now accounts for roughly 6% of Apple's total revenue (and an even greater proportion of gross profit), triple what it accounted for just three years ago. However, bears remain skeptical of the App Store/Services narrative for four reasons. They believe: 1) App Store take rates are not defensible, 2) the current level of App Store growth is unsustainable, 3) Services margins are at, or near, peak levels and 4) Apple is still a consumer electronics company and therefore should be valued as one, not as a platform business. Exhibit 4: While the iPhone has historically accounted for â…” of Apple revenue mix, Services is becoming a bigger piece of the revenue pie...

We disagree with the skeptics and believe the App Store, and Services more broadly, hold the key to Apple's future. For one, the App Store reflects the attractiveness of 2197 Apple's customer base, where 1) app downloads per device are double that of Google Play, 2) spend per download is 4x Google Play (Exhibit 6) and 3) spend per device is 10x Google Play (Exhibit 7). Additionally, the App Store is well diversified by end-market exposure, with 71% of revenue growth coming from China, US and Japan (in C1Q18), and all other countries (80+) accounting for 29% of revenue growth, up from 15% just 12 months ago (Exhibit 9). Taken together, these factors make us confident in our App Store revenue forecast, which we have decelerating from 30% growth this year to 22% Y/Y by 2021. Exhibit 6: The App Store generates more than 4x net revenue per                                                  Exhibit 7: â€¦while on a per device basis, the App Store generates over download vs. Google Play...                                                                                      10x net revenue compared to Google Play.

Despite this growth deceleration, the relative size of the App Store compared to Apple's more nascent but faster growing Services businesses, such as Apple Pay, Apple Music and iCloud (Exhibit 10), combined with the App Store's strong margin profile, means that the App Store should account for the majority of Services revenue growth going forward (Exhibit 11), which will subsequently drive margin expansion within the Services business. In other words, Services margins are not peaking (Exhibit 12).

As the Services business grows as a percentage of revenue and gross profit, we believe it will become Apple's primary growth driver over the next five years (Exhibit 13). As a result, investors need to value Apple shares using a target multiple that accounts for this higher margin, recurring revenue stream. Our updated sum-of-the-parts based valuation methodology does just that and drives our new $214 price target (up from $200 prior), which implies a 15.5x target P/E on our FY19 EPS of $13.76, 1 turn above our prior target multiple of 14.5x but below Apple's 10-year average P/E multiple of 15.8x.

What we learned from earnings: (+) Services becoming primary growth driver. Services revenue grew 31% y/y, faster than 27% growth in December (Exhibit 1), despite significant scale ($33B LTM revenue). We don't see Services growth slowing anytime soon given the many growth levers, including: 1) fewer than half of users pay for services and the paying customer base is growing strong double-digits. 2) a broadening data center footprint and new payment methods improve the services experience, and 3) strong growth in relatively nascent services like Music and Pay along with upcoming services like Video. Apple grew Services more than 25% in every region and across offerings. Even if Services growth stabilizes from here, we see Apple approaching its $50B Services revenue target a year early in FY19, rather than FY20.                                                                               Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a (+/-) iPhone units and ASPs will decline less than expected in June. Weaker         result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a iPhone supplier results suggested meaningful downside in the June quarter which     conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider didn't come to fruition. While forecasted iPhone shipments of 39M units is lower    Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making than our 42M estimate a month ago, it's far better than our 34M estimate which      their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, reflected the weaker June quarter outlook from suppliers like TSMC and AMS.         refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this Further, iPhone ASPs will actually decline less than seasonal in June given March   report. 3051 quarter sell-through ASPs were higher than reported given the iPhone X channel inventory drawdown (iPhone channel inventory declined 1.8M units in March). (=) Margins stable despite near-term headwinds. Memory remained a 70bps headwind to gross margin in the March quarter, though management expects NAND to become more favorable near-term and DRAM prices to decline heading into year-end - largely unchanged from three months ago. With currency hedges offsetting the benefit of a weaker dollar and weaker volume q/q, Apple was still able to hold overall gross margin flat q/q better than guidance for a decline. We believe the primary offset is growing Services mix where gross margins are close to 60%, by our estimates. Services revenue mix increased to 15% in March from 10% in the December quarter and 13% the year prior. While many investors are asking whether Apple might price its next line of iPhones much more aggressively, management commentary suggested a consistent strategy of pricing to value with each new iPhone carrying more technology and a higher bill-of- materials. We do see the weaker dollar and falling memory and other component prices as an opportunity to perhaps lower starting prices modestly, but any significant change in pricing strategy is unlikely, in our view. (=) Apple prefers buybacks over dividends in light of undervalued shares. Apple didn't provide a comparable two-year cumulative capital return update as in recent years but did announce an incremental $100B share repurchase authorization which we believe the company could complete in 12-18 months with another step up in repurchase authorization a year from now. Net, we see Apple completing $120B of share buybacks over the next six quarters which combined with a 16% dividend increase allows the company to exit FY19 with ~$95B of net cash presenting additional ammunition for long-term capital return or acquisitions. (?) A large inventory increase has investors scratching their heads. Apple inventory increased $3.2B q/q to $7.6B, the largest ever quarterly increase. We expect more disclosure in Apple's 10-Q filing later this week which is likely to show the inventory build is concentrated in components rather than finished goods. We believe Apple continued to pre-buy commodities in tight supply, pointing to memory, and take advantage of volume discounts on components with a single supplier, like OLED panels and the A11 processor. Despite the inventory increase, FCF of $10.9B increased $1.4B y/y in March. 3062"

That said, we would be buyers on any weakness following the print given 1) the Services story remains intact, (leading to a stronger and more consistent source of EPS growth and margin expansion), 2) estimate revisions are approaching trough (we already assume no device revenue growth next three years), and 3) buybacks remain a source of downside protection. We lower our March and June quarter iPhone shipment estimates by 7M (1M in March, 6M in June; FY18 iPhone shipments now at 210M, from 217M), while increasing expectations for both buybacks and dividends, resulting in FY18e EPS of $11.00 (down from $11.60) and FY19e EPS of $13.80 (down from $14.00) (Exhibit 1 & Exhibit 2). We remain Overweight with a price target of $200 (down from $203), for 16% upside from current prices. We expect an in-line quarter...We believe that Apple will post March quarter results that are at the low end of its previously issued guidance and in-line with our updated estimates. Our proprietary AlphaWise iPhone demand tracker points        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a to sell out of 54M in the March quarter (Exhibit 3), however we expect channel       result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a inventory reduction of ~2M units in the quarter after record inventory build in      conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider December, which drives our March quarter shipment estimate of 52.3M units            Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making (down from 53.3M prior), representing 3% Y/Y growth (Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5).       their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, With the rest of our March quarter estimates unchanged, we forecast revenue of       refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this $60.2B, a gross margin of 38.5% and EPS of $2.69, which compares to consensus        report. 3661 of $61.1B, 38.5% and $2.69, respectively. We see slight risk to March Q consensus revenue estimates as we think consensus iPhone shipments (53.8M) and ASP ($741) could be aggressive vs. our 52.3M and $718 forecast, respectively. ...But are cautious ahead of the print as June quarter ests appear to be too high. We believe the June quarter consensus iPhone shipment estimate of 42.9M could be revised meaningfully lower to account for weak supply chain data points and continued weakness in China data. Our Asia smartphone supply chain team, led by Sharon Shih, recently lowered June quarter iPhone builds to 32M (from 36M previously) to account for weaker iPhone X and 8/8+ demand ahead of September's expected new iPhone launch. Over the last 5 years, June quarter iPhone builds have largely approximated reported iPhone shipments (Exhibit 6), which drives our cautious view vs. consensus iPhone shipments of 42.9M. Additionally, China smartphone activation data (Exhibit 7) points to a reversal in Apple share trajectory with losses through March that presents a meaningful headwind in the largest smartphone market. As such, we lower our June quarter iPhone shipment estimate to 34M (-17% Y/Y), from 40.5M, which is now 20% below consensus, and model June quarter revenue of $46.2B (vs. consensus of $52.1B) and EPS of $1.80 (vs. consensus of $2.18). As was the case in the last two June quarters, we expect Apple revenue guidance to come in below current consensus estimates, with gross margin guidance likely in the 37.5-38.5% range reflecting volume pressure and still elevated DRAM prices with the benefit of the weaker dollar and lower NAND prices more meaningful to 2H18 results. We model June quarter gross margin of 38.0%, down 50 bps Q/Q and down from our prior 39.4% forecast. Apple Services becoming the primary growth driver. Despite our cautious view into earnings, we do believe that Services results will show the Apple platform story, which we highlighted last month, is still intact. Coming into this quarter, Apple's normalized Services revenue per week accelerated for 3 consecutive quarters, to 27% Y/Y growth in the December quarter. March represents a normal 13-week quarter with no one-time adjustments or abnormal Y/Y comparisons, and we model Services revenue accelerating to $9.0B, up 28% Y/Y. Part of our confidence in this story comes from App Store results, which we estimate generated $3.4B in revenue in the March quarter (+29% Y/Y), an acceleration from 26% Y/Y growth in C4Q17 (Exhibit 8). In the March quarter, 8 of the top 10 App Store countries posted an acceleration in Y/Y growth, with App Store revenue from China surpassing $1B for the first time and â…“ of all countries growing >50% Y/Y. Additionally, Apple Music surpassed 40M paid subs at March quarter end, from ""well over 30M"" in C4Q17, and was adding paid subs at a rate of 60-80k/day, up from 30-50k/day in December 2017 (Exhibit 9), which we estimate drove a ~75% Y/Y increase in Apple Music revenue in the quarter. Importantly, while we model a 7% decline in core device revenue (iPhone, iPad, Mac) in the June quarter, total Apple revenue will still grow on the back of accelerating Services growth and Other Device revenue. As more durable, higher margin Services become the central driver of growth, we see room for further re- rating of AAPL shares. Supply chain noise on next product cycle ramping; will a weak June guide even matter? Supply chain checks point to Apple launching 3 new iPhone models in C2H18 - a 6.5"" OLED iPhone Xs Plus, a 5.8"" OLED iPhone Xs and a 6.1"" LCD iPhone priced in the $700-800 range - with total builds expected to be 100M in C2H18 3672 (vs. 89M builds for the 8/8+ and X in C2H17), split 60/40 between OLED and LCD SKUs. Our Greater China Hardware research team currently expects component designs to be finalized in May, with the earliest timing for component production to kick-off in mid to late May. With expectations for this year's models to be released on-time and priced more favorably than the current line-up (due to more favorable NAND and other component pricing), investors may look through the especially weak June quarter iPhone shipments into the September quarter where consensus is modeling a reasonable 47M, or +1% Y/Y, September iPhone shipments (we model 46M shipments in Sept Q). We expect Apple to announce a $150B increase to its total capital return program. Apple's long-held approach to capital returns has been to distribute 100% of fully taxed FCF to shareholders over time. And since the inception of its capital return program in August 2012 (through December 2017), Apple has generated approximately $240B in fully tax-effected FCF, and returned a cumulative $240B to shareholders (73% repurchases/27% dividends). Over the last 2 years, Apple expanded its capital return program by $50B annually, with the current capital return program calling for $300B in cumulative capital returns ($210B earmarked for repurchases) through March 2019. However, with $163B of â€˜dry powderâ€™ available to return to shareholders post US tax reform, in addition to ongoing FCF generation, we expect a meaningful uptick in Apple's capital return program on May 1st. In our base case, we believe that Apple returns the $163B in excess cash over a 3 year period, with $100B earmarked for the next 2 years and the remainder for the following year. This would imply Apple announces a $150B increase in the capital return program on May 1st - consisting of the run-rate $50B increase plus $100B from the excess cash (Exhibit 10) - to a cumulative total of $450B, with expiration extended to March 2020. As a result, we believe Apple will accelerate repurchases to an annual rate of $80B in FY18-FY19, from the $30B current annual run rate, and could raise the quarterly dividend by 50% this year, to $0.945/share, before reverting back to 10% annual dividend increases in the years to follow. This would imply Apple repurchases $210B in shares and pays $52B in dividends over the next 3 years, ~$130B above the historical run rate, with around $30B set aside for potential M&A (Exhibit 11). While we had already accounted for a sizable step-up in share repurchases in FY18-19, we now front-end load them slightly moreso than prior, and model $160B of buybacks in FY18-19 vs. $137B prior. Additionally, the 50% dividend raise is new (we previously modeled a 10% Y/Y dividend increase) and implies Apple trades at a >2% dividend yield. 3683"

With close to $200 billion in excess cash and FCF available over the next 12 months, Apple can support the stock as the investment thesis evolves from one of product cycle- to services-led growth. Introducing our interactive Apple Platform Model: Base case = 5% next-five-year revenue CAGR; Bull = 11%; Bear (2)%. We have created an interactive model that allows clients to make multi-year assumptions behind Apple device replacement cycles, installed base growth, ASP trends, and services spend per device. We are modestly more negative on hardware replacement cycles in our new base case estimates (Exhibit 7 and Exhibit 8), to reflect weaker market demand in China and US carrier comments at our TMT conference earlier this month. Our new base case demonstrates the stability of the model even in a scenario of iPhone replacement cycles elongating further: It assumes that Apple device shipments       Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with and revenue decline every year for the next six years while services revenue per    companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a device growth is unchanged at 8% annually. The conclusion is Apple can still        conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of generate top-line growth of 5% annually, even with a declining device business,     Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making so long as services revenue per device continues to grow. Our bull case assumes     their investment decision. mid single digit device revenue and 11% installed base growth (through 2024)        For analyst certification and other important disclosures, refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this with accelerating services revenue per device, for an 11% next-five-year revenue    report. 4181 CAGR. In our bear case, device installed base slows to low single digits, and ASPs come under pressure while Services revenue per device slows materially, Apple revenue will decline at a 2% CAGR in the bear case. Services revenue per device is growing 8% annually... Apple Services revenue grew at a 23% CAGR over the past two years, a function of 14% installed base and 8% revenue per device growth. We estimate that services annual revenue per device currently stands at ~$30, up from $25/device just two years ago. However, this metric underestimates the long-term revenue potential for a number of reasons. First, the majority of Apple users don't yet pay for services, suggesting that revenue per ""active"" user is well above, and possibly double, the $30 level. Second, services revenue is growing Y/Y for every customer cohort and in every region, suggesting that at maturity revenue per device could approach $100 or more (Exhibit 20). We don't view this as a stretch given Amazon Prime has 106M users paying $99/year and Netflix has 111M paid subs spending $120/year. Third, Apple disclosed last quarter that they have 240M paid subscriptions across their Services offerings, equivalent to 18% of the total device installed base, leaving much room for improved recurring revenue. ...and shows no sign of slowing given lots of low hanging fruit. We see a number of levers Apple can pull to accelerate services monetization: 1) Apple Music: Paid subscribers grew 80% in 2017, slightly faster than peers, with penetration of just 2.9% of total Apple devices (Exhibit 31). 2) iCloud: Subscribers are growing even faster than Apple Music and two recently announced data center launches in China, one of which went live February 28, should meaningfully improve the user experience and drive increasing user penetration in coming quarters (Exhibit 30). 3) Apple Pay: Now works in 50% of all US retail locations, but usage remains low and that's likely to change as consumers become more comfortable with mobile wallet technology and international markets catch-up to the US (Exhibit 32 & Exhibit 34). 4) App Store: Broadening payment options can accelerate demand. The introduction of WeChat Pay and AliPay as methods of payment on the App Store coincided with accelerating App Store growth in 2017 (Exhibit 22), and China is now both the largest and one of the fastest growing app store regions globally. Yet, in some other countries, such as Brazil, Apple still requires payment via credit cards, which we expect to change in the future. 5) Subscription Churn: Apple recently added team members with experience managing subscription businesses, and as a result, user churn declined meaningfully in the December quarter, accelerating subscriber and overall services revenue growth (Exhibit 19). 6) New offerings like original content and AR-centric apps on the App Store are easy wins that can both convert new users and increase spend of existing services users as new content is added to the platform. Services becoming primary growth driver argues for multiple expansion. To reflect recent negative smartphone data points, such as slowing growth in China and elongating replacement cycles in the US, we lower our iPhone unit growth over the next five years (Exhibit 7 & Exhibit 8). While this puts pressure on our near-term EPS forecast - $14 in FY19 vs. $14.50 previously - services mix shift accelerates gross margin expansion which along with a larger expected share repurchases delivers FY17-22E EPS CAGR of 16%, up from 8% over the last five years. With a stronger and more consistent source of EPS growth, we have increasing confidence in multiple expansion. In fact, a sum of the parts analysis that credits Apple's hardware business with a multiple that blends HPQ and 4192 MSFT and Apple's services business with the average of consumer platform peers (Exhibit 6) provides additional support for our $203 PT, translating to a 14.5x P/E or half a turn higher than our previous view on slightly lower EPS. Services metrics worth monitoring: Device installed base growth, Apple Services paid subscribers, payments to the developer community/App Store revenue, apps available on iOS, app downloads, Apple Music subscribers, Apple Pay country availability, # of contactless-ready Apple Pay locations (Exhibit 24 - Exhibit 34). 4203 Framing Our Scenario Analysis Why we think investors should prioritize their time on Apple Services. Over the past 5 years, Apple investors have primarily focused their time and attention on the burgeoning importance of the iPhone. And rightfully so, given the product now contributes 62% of total company revenue, and grew at a 12% CAGR over the last 5 years. However, as smartphone replacement cycles extend and growth slows with lower carrier subsidies, higher quality devices, and maturing penetration, the period of outsized device growth is likely behind us. As a result, we believe that investors need to shift focus to Apple's Services business to better understand the company's ability to grow revenue long-term. Why? Because we see a scenario where replacement cycles extend further, device installed base growth slows to single digits (from 14% over the last 2 years) and Apple still generates low-to-mid single digit revenue growth. How? Increasing services monetization, which we see as the key priority for Apple going forward. With close to $200 billion in excess cash and FCF available to use over the next 12 months, Apple can support the stock as the investment thesis evolves from one of product cycle- to services-led growth.

In our base case, we assume that replacement cycles continue to extend towards 4.5 years, implying an iPhone replacement cycle close to 4 years, as Apple total device shipments decline 50bps annually and device installed base grows mid-single digits, with ASPs flat as Apple continues to innovate on the device side and drive users towards newer technologies. We view our unit assumptions as rather conservative given smartphone replacement cycles are approaching PC replacement cycles today, a device that arguably isn't as mobile and is used less frequently. Additionally, services revenue per device growth stays flat with 2018 at 7.7% as some of the low hanging fruit we discuss, like iCloud in China, expansion of original content and a greater diversity of payment forms comes to fruition. In this scenario, Apple revenue would grow at 5% every year through 2024, implying that only slight device declines coupled with a flatline in services revenue per user growth (despite the low hanging fruit that should otherwise accelerate spend) would be enough to keep Apple's revenue trajectory modestly positive. Importantly, we believe this analysis could prove to be conservative given it implies no new product category launches, no stabilization in the handset replacement cycle in the next 5 years and a significant slowdown in installed base growth from the last 2 years.

However, e = Morgan Stanley Research estimates, a = Actual Company reported data Android replacement cycles elongated (Exhibit 1) despite iPhone replacement cycles shrinking in 4Q17 (Exhibit 2), which reduced the switcher opportunity (31M by our estimates) compared to our bottom-up model. This suggests 4Q17 shipment share gains were driven largely driven by stronger upgrades within Apple's installed base while lower churn drove the installed base share gains. Overall iPhone active smartphone user share downticked in early January from recent highs but iPhone X share gains accelerating in China... According to data from Jiguang, a firm that aggregates smartphone data from its push-messaging services in China, iPhone had 20.6% share of the active smartphone market in China in the 4 week period ending January 14th, 2018, down from 21.8% in the prior 4 week period ending December 31, 2017 (Exhibit 3). This represents the second largest period over period share loss since we began tracking this data in January 2017 (largest was in August 2017), with market share largely picked up by the big 4 Chinese smartphone vendors (Exhibit 4). Importantly for Apple, and despite the overall share loss vs. peers, adoption of the iPhone X continued to      Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a accelerate in the latest period, accounting for over 3% of the iPhone active         result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a installed base in China, up 73bps period over period. This compares to market        conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider share of 1.36% (+16bps period/period) and 2.63% (+29bps period/period) for the       Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, respectively (Exhibit 5). Importantly, on a daily average       their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, share gain basis, share gains for the iPhone X continued to accelerate in C1Q18      refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this (Exhibit 6).                                                                         report. 4541 ...Which implies weaker legacy iPhone model sales beyond the holiday season. While the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X gained share in the active iPhone base in China in the 4 week period ending January 14, 2018, the iPhone 6 and later models, which make up the largest share of the active iPhone base in China, lost share at an accelerating rate (Exhibit 7). In fact, if we include all legacy iPhone models collectively, we estimate that the 4 week period ended Jan. 14th marked the first period since the September product launch where iPhone activations fell period over period for the older devices (Exhibit 9). Declining volume and share of older models as new models gain momentum isn't a surprise. However, the reversal of the trend compared to 4Q17 is notable. We believe two factors slowed activations of older devices. First, our analysis suggests the mix of new users from refurbished/re-used devices is higher in China than Apple's overall business and this contributed to installed base growth in the December quarter (Exhibit 10). Second, Apple selling iPhone 6 at a $350 starting point and iPhone 7/7+ $130-200 below the new iPhone 8/8+ accelerated demand for older products. However that demand seems to be fading as Chinese brands respond to significant share loss in the mid-market during 4Q17. In light of expected new product launches in 2Q17, we wouldn't be surprised if the mid-market pricing environment intensifies near-term as Chinese brands flush inventory of existing products. Net, we forecast modest iPhone growth in FY18, with China still representing the market with most growth potential. While we acknowledge that this iPhone cycle is not the ""supercycle"" we previously expected, with 4% total iPhone unit growth estimated in FY18 (to 226M units), we continue to believe that the accelerating adoption of Apple's highest end iPhone in the worlds largest smartphone market will drive active smartphone market share gains for Apple in the periods ahead. Importantly, a rising retention rate (Exhibit 11) and a switching rate above peers (Exhibit 12) shows that Apple platform share gains can still accelerate as the market matures. With over â…“ of the Apple installed base in China still owning an iPhone 6 or older model compared to 20% that owned an iPhone 5S or older a year ago, there remains significant untapped potential for continued upgrades/share gains. 4552 Exhibits Exhibit 1: China Smartphone Replacement Cycle Elongated in 4Q17â€¦ Smartphone Industry Sales as % of Install Base (3-Yr) 18%                                                      North America        China        Global 16% 16%                          14% 14%                                    13%         13% 12%                           12%          11%               12% 12%                                                                   11%         11% 11% 11% 10% 10%                                                                                               9% 9% 8% 6% 4% 2% 0% 2013Q4                2014Q4             2015Q4            2016Q4          2017Q4 Source: IDC, Morgan Stanley Research Exhibit 2: â€¦But the iPhone Replacement Cycle Actually Shrank for Apple in China, Driving Share Gains iPhone Sales as % of Install Base (3-Yr) 25%                                                      North America            China      Global 19% 20% 16%         17% 15% 15%                                   15% 15%            14%                                                    14%   14% 13% 13% 12%                     11%             12% 12% 10% 5% 0% 2013Q4                2014Q4             2015Q4            2016Q4          2017Q4 Source: IDC, Morgan Stanley Research 4563"

Inventory dynamics provide mixed signals for suppliers. From a supply chain perspective, the higher levels of inventory at Apple and at suppliers could translate to slower unit growth relative to sell-out for Apple devices in the near- term, which our US Semiconductor team led by Joe Moore published on today. Interestingly, off-balance sheet purchase commitments for outsourcing and components at the end of December 2017 - essentially Apple's commitment to manufacture product and purchase components in the near future - grew 40% Y/Y and fell only 11% Q/Q, less than the 3-year historical seasonal decline of 19% (Exhibit 3). This would suggest a robust growth outlook or that the company revised its view of demand after the end of the quarter. Any meaningful revision or lack thereof to this line item at the end of March will be an important indicator of the company's view of growth heading into the FY19 product cycle.        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with To complicate the supply chain discussion further, while Apple is carrying            companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a roughly $2B of excess balance sheet inventory which we believe ties to pre-           conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of purchases of commodities, like DRAM and NAND. One potential explanation is            Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making that demand for certain NAND capacities, likely the higher 256GB iPhone version,      their investment decision. is surprising to the upside.                                                          For analyst certification and other important disclosures, refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this Normalized December gross margin slightly better than reported. We calculate          report. 4821 normalized December gross margin of 38.5%, slightly above reported gross margin of 38.4%, after adjusting for: (1) FX hedging headwind, (2) minimal warranty impact and (3) minimal non-designated derivatives impact (Exhibit 7). FX hedge losses pressured reported gross margin by -10bps in December, turning from a +10bps boost in the prior year. Warranty expense had a non-material impact on reported gross margin and improved from a 90bps drag on the year ago reported gross margin. We calculate the impact of warranty expenses by comparing reported warranty expense to normalized expense based on three year average ratios to hardware revenue. Apple recently began breaking out gains/losses on non-designated derivatives which was an insignificant impact to December quarter reported gross margin, down from a 20bps tailwind a year ago. Adjusting for these three items, Apple's normalized gross margin of 38.5% fell 60bps Y/Y relative to down 10bps Y/Y on a reported basis as the year ago adjusted margin benefited from backing out the 90bps warranty drag, partially offset by a turn in FX hedging impact Y/Y. Capital expenditure plans remain $16B in FY18. The company expects to spend $16B in Capex for FY18, unchanged from guidance provided last quarter. FY18 expectations reflect more modest 7% growth in spending Y/Y, following accelerated growth of 16% and 14% Y/Y in FY17 and FY16, respectively - though the completion of Apple's new headquarters is likely a contributing factor to slower Capex growth. 4832 Analysis Exhibit 1: Inventory at Apple and mfg partners up more than                                                                       Exhibit 2: â€¦ and up almost 100% Y/Y seasonalâ€¦ Non-Vendor Trade Receivables and Inventory Non-Vendor Trade Receivables and Inventory                                                                                        Y/Y Q/Q                                                                                                                               100%                                                                                         92% 50%                               41%                                                                                  41%        80% 33%                 31% 23%                                                                   60%                                    46%                                         45% 25%                                      10%                                                                                     40% 7%                          5%                                                        6%                                               18% 21% 0%                                                                                                                             20%          2% -4%                                                                                                                   0% -11%                                                 -1% -25%                                                                                                                             -20% -9% -21% -40% Mar-16 Mar-17 Dec-15 Sep-16 Dec-16 Sep-17 Dec-17 Jun-16 Jun-17 -50%                            -42% Dec-06 Dec-07 Dec-08 Dec-09 Dec-10 Dec-11 Dec-12 Dec-13 Dec-14 Dec-15 Dec-16 Dec-17 Source: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research Source: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research Exhibit 3: However, off-balance sheet commitments remain elevated indicating a more robust growth outlook or a very recent revision to iPhone growth outlook Off-Balance Sheet Commitments Q/Q 3-Yr Avg Seasonality                                    20% 20%                           Dec Q/Q 10%                                                                  8% 0% -10%                                                                                                                         -7% -11% -19%                                                                             -15% -20% Outsourcing and                     Other Obligations Q/Q Total Off-Balance Sheet Components Q/Q                                              Commitments Q/Q Source: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research 4843"

On the other hand, the Apple platform is healthy. Device installed base grew 30% over the past two years and customer satisfaction is at record highs (Exhibit 1). This translates to growing share of smartphone users even as overall market growth slows. Given strong retention rates, Apple will see ASPs rise this year without any slowing of user growth. In fact, Apple's share of China smartphone users accelerated post the iPhone X launch (Exhibit 2). Services growth accelerated from 22% exiting 2016 to 27% today (on an avg. weekly sales basis), and will account for more than 30% of gross profit dollars by 2021 (from 20% in FY17). With the stock trading at less than 12x our FY19 EPS of $14.50, we expect the company to return a considerable portion of its $163B excess cash to shareholders over the next two years. Net, we see more positive than negative catalysts post lowered iPhone expectations. While our FY18 EPS falls to $11.85 (from $13) reflecting slower iPhone unit growth (+4% vs. +15% previously), FY19 increases to $14.50 (from $14.28) on Services led revenue growth and the full impact of tax reform. We see shares trading at a slightly lower multiple of 14x,     Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a versus 15.4x previously, to reflect slower unit growth and higher contribution       result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a from tax rate.

Investors should consider shift to FY19 EPS of $14.50, which fully reflects the iPhone X upgrade cycle and     Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making benefits of tax reform.                                                              their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, What we learned from December quarter earnings:                                      refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this report. 5091 (-) Smartphone replacement cycles elongating in China but Apple share gains accelerating. iPhone shipment declines in North America (-0.6% Y/Y) and slight growth in EMEA (+2.1% Y/Y) were generally in-line with our bottom up iPhone upgrade and switcher analysis. Apple China revenue growth accelerated to 19% (normalized for 14-week quarter a year ago), from 12% in September but less than our bottom-up analysis suggested. We attribute the underperformance to elongating upgrade cycles for Android devices (Exhibit 3), which reduces Apple's available switcher opportunity. The trend of elongated Android replacement cycles is represented in IDC's estimate of a 4Q17 China smartphone shipment decline of 13%, decelerating from 4% growth in the prior twelve months. Importantly, iPhone replacement rates actually accelerated as did iPhone growth in China (+12%) (Exhibit 4) and both our recently published Jiguang data and IDC data point to meaningful Apple share gains in China (Exhibit 2). (+) Services growth acceleration continues as retention rates drive strong double-digit installed base growth. Apple's active installed base of devices grew 30% over the past two years to 1.3B. This compares to only 2% annual unit shipment growth over the same period, highlighting industry low churn rates that drive installed base growth even in periods of low/no growth. As the device installed base grows, Apple expands its portfolio of Services, and the company improves subscription churn rates and user engagement. Services growth accelerated to 27% normalized growth in December from 25% in September and 21% a year ago. Services is becoming an even more important element of the Apple story, contributing over 30% of gross profit by the end of 2021 allowing for total company revenue and EPS growth even without device revenue growth beyond FY19. (+) Apple could buyback more than 20% of shares. Apple ended the December quarter with $163B of net cash and announced its intention to shift to a neutral net cash position (cash = debt) over a reasonable time horizon on the back of recently announced US tax reform. Combined with $44B of expected FCF over the next 12-months, Apple could technically buy back ~25% of outstanding shares over the next year. In practicality, we expect the company to earmark a modest portion of the $163B of net cash to acquisitions ($4B is Apple's record year of acquisition spend) and return the rest to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, likely during a multi-year period. We view the current mix of capital return - roughly 75% buybacks / 25% dividends - as a fair assumption of the mix going forward. 5102 Exhibit 1: US customer satisfaction for the iPhone remains around all time highs iPhone US Customer Satisfaction 98% 97%                    97%                                               97% 97% 97% 96%                                           96% 96% 96% 95% 95% 95% 94% F4Q16               F1Q17               F2Q17               F3Q17         F4Q17      F1Q18 Source: 451 Research, Morgan Stanley Research Exhibit 2: iPhone market share of smartphone shipments almost doubled Q/Q as the China smartphone market declined 13% Y/Y while China iPhone shipments grew 12% Y/Y Source: Jigaung, IDC, Morgan Stanley Research; Data through December 31, 2017 Exhibit 3: China Smartphone Replacement Cycle Elongatedâ€¦ Smartphone Industry Sales as % of Install Base (3-Yr) 18%                                                       North America             China       Global 16% 16%                        14% 14%                                    13%         13% 12%                            12%             11%                  12% 12%                                                                        11%          11% 11% 11% 10% 10%                                                                                                   9% 9% 8% 6% 4% 2% 0% 2013Q4                  2014Q4                  2015Q4             2016Q4        2017Q4 Source: IDC, Morgan Stanley Research 5113"

Greater China revenue growth of 12% in the September quarter, already accelerated from -10% Y/Y in June, and we see the potential for a similar step-up in growth during December. Even after contemplating increased price elasticity late in the iPhone X cycle and some push out of upgrades on cheaper battery replacements and new product rumors, we model revenue and EPS 9% and 13% above consensus in FY18 largely driven by our higher iPhone ASPs and bullish China thesis. We also now model slight iPhone and total revenue growth in FY19, compared to declines previously, on the back of an easier comp and delayed upgrades. We agree with the market view of a December quarter earnings beat. Apple produced as much as 6-7M more iPhone X units than we originally modeled (see report Hon Hai Precision: iPhone X Builds Boost the Revenue Scale and Thus Profit) which after considering some spill-over of shipments into March and cannibalization of lower-end units, we raise December quarter iPhone shipments       Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a to 80M (from 76M) and iPhone ASP to $819 (from $771). After adjusting Mac,           result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a iPad, and Watch shipments to align with recent supply chain and carrier              conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider comments and Services revenue to consider the tough comp from the 14th week          Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making a year ago, our total company revenue increases to $92.2B (from $86.3B) and          their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, EPS to $4.12 (from $3.79). We are now 6% above consensus revenue and 8%              refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this above consensus EPS for the December quarter largely on higher iPhone ASPs.          report. 5711 We disagree with the market view of a March quarter guide down. We lower our above consensus March quarter iPhone units and revenue by 9.5M, and $8.4B to reflect the pull-in of iPhone X shipments to the December quarter and a modest impact from cheaper battery replacement costs on older iPhones. Our 64.5M March quarter iPhone shipment forecast is inline with Morgan Stanley Greater China Hardware analyst Sharon Shih's recently published databook, but slightly ahead of the consensus view of 61M. Importantly, even after contemplating lower overall units and lower iPhone X mix (31M, down from 44M previously), we model ASP of $815 vs consensus of $752 in the March quarter. Our March quarter ASP falls only slightly from our previous forecast due to feedback from carriers on a lower retail discount which we now model at 7% versus 12% previously (Exhibit 3 & Exhibit 4). This significant ASP gap versus consensus provides air cover for any unit softness as iPhone units would have to miss current consensus of 61M by over 5M to translate to a guide down all else equal, in our view. Press reports around lower supply chain orders in the March and June quarters largely noise, but we now contemplate price elasticity later in the cycle. We believe the majority of noise around supply chain ""cuts"" tie to the faster than expected ramp of iPhone production in the December quarter (pull-in from March) and inventory disparities across the supply chain that are typically corrected once products are fully ramped. However, there is also an argument that as new products mature and more demand comes from late adopters, Apple could see a shift away from higher priced, new SKUs toward recently discounted older SKUs like iPhone 7 and iPhone 6 which was re-introduced in China last year. Our lower FY18 estimates contemplate this dynamic as well as recently reduced battery replacement prices ($29 vs. $79 previously for iPhone 6 and older) and news flow around a broader line-up of iPhone X-like products, including larger screen and cheaper versions, both of which could push some upgrade demand into FY19. See our detailed estimate changes in Exhibit 5 & Exhibit 6. Key metrics to watch in the quarter. 1) iPhone ASP north of $800, 2) China growth acceleration, 3) sustained services growth, and 4) at least in-line March Q guidance, are key to driving the next move higher for AAPL shares. December iPhone shipments are more a read on production than demand however iPhone ASP (we model $819 vs Street $752) is an important confirmation of Appleâ€™s ability to pass through the cost of new features and could put upward pressure on consensus estimates. Our view of double-digit iPhone unit growth in FY18 largely centers on a re-acceleration in China. China revenue grew 12% Y/Y in September and we look for a further acceleration to confirm our thesis. Services growth faces a difficult compare given the 14 week quarter a year ago which added 8 points of growth. Considering the tough comp, Apple needs to report 16% services growth to sustain the 25% normalized run-rate from September. Finally, given investors are concerned about a March quarter guide down, at least in-line with sell-side consensus March Q revenue guidance is required to support shares, a more than reasonable assumption given the downside protection from lower ASPs. We expect constructive commentary on tax reform and gross margin. Apple should be a beneficiary of tax reform. A lowered tax rate (we estimate 15.9%) could add $1.13 to FY18e EPS and $1.86 to FY19e EPS, not yet in our model. In light of strong FCF generation (avg $54B anually last three years), we believe 5722 Apple should run closer to net neutral cash post tax reform, which leaves $115B to spend (after $38B repatriation tax) on share repurchases, dividend payments or M&A. Our current estimates only consider $50B of incremental buybacks compared to Apple's recent $30B run-rate. Assuming the incremental buyback over two years doubles to $100B adds more than $0.60 to FY19e EPS. We also recently raised our FY18e gross margin to 39.1%, ahead of consensus of 38.7%, to reflect tailwind from the weaker dollar and falling NAND prices but see further upside if Services and iPhone mix shift continue. 5733"

Within this data, we see that iPhone X adoption        Q4        2.07      -    2.98                              -         2.82 continues to ramp faster than the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus at the comparable period         e = Morgan Stanley Research estimates after launch, with iPhone X capturing 1.64% of the Apple active user base vs. 1.32% for iPhone 8 Plus and 0.65% for iPhone 8 (Exhibit 2), despite iPhone X only being available for 72 days vs. 97 days for the 8/8 Plus. Adjusted for total selling days, iPhone X gained 3.7bps of share in the Apple active user base per day through December 19th vs. 2.3bps for the iPhone 8 Plus and 1.1bps for the iPhone 8 at the comparable time period (Exhibit 3). Given these strong and accelerating data points for the iPhone, and iPhone X in particular, we remain confident in our thesis that Apple is turning the corner in China and growth will accelerate in the quarters to come. Retention Rates and Switching Rates continue to dwarf competition. The 4 week period ending December 17th marked the 2nd 4-week period with a full 28 days of iPhone X data, and as Exhibit 4 highlights, Apple's retention rate continues to climb faster than competitors. In fact, Apple's retention rate increased 794bps in the past two months, while their next closest competitor, Huawei, experienced          Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with less than half the improvement, to 37% (vs. 60% at Apple).

Recall, as of the 4 week period ending November 19th, the largest portion, 48%, of iPhone X upgraders had come from the iPhone 7/7+ base while only 30% came from the larger base of 3+ year old iPhones (iPhone 6 and older) signaling demand from early adopters of new technology rather than traditional upgrades from the aged installed base. Fast forward one month and the data shows that in the 4-week period ending December 19th, only 37% of upgraders to the iPhone X came from 7/7+ while a larger 39% came from the aged base of iPhone 6 (and older) (Exhibit 6). Importantly, the installed base of 3+ year old iPhones in China is double levels of a year ago (Exhibit 7), which supports our view of a strong and extended upgrade cycle in the region. Price cuts on older iPhones help extend Apple's reach to the mid-market in China. While much of the iPhone conversation hinges on demand for the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X, we believe itâ€™s important to highlight that data through December 17th shows that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus continue to see increasing market share of the active iPhone user base in China (Exhibit 8). In fact, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus account for just above 25% of the active iPhone user base, up from 23.8% in the period prior to the September 2017 iPhone launch. Additionally, 3rd party industry reports recently highlighted that the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 were the #2 and #5, respectively, best-selling smartphones in China in 2017, despite their seemingly iterative updates from the iPhone 6s. We believe the primary drivers of demand for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the aging iPhone 6 installed base and lower price points, which were discounted by 10-15% last September following Appleâ€™s most recent iPhone launch. We believe the discounted iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 help Apple address the mid-market in China more so than in the past. Separately, MS Greater China Technology Hardware analyst Sharon Shih recently raised her legacy iPhone builds by 6M units in the December and March quarters, citing increased demand for legacy iPhone models, which we believe supports this view. Supply chain noise driving unreasonably low March Q buy-side expectations, in our view. In the last month two factors created noise around iPhone supply chain order revisions. First, Apple was able to build 7-8M more iPhone X units that we originally thought for December and that pulls in production from the March quarter. Secondly, some iPhone suppliers without yield issues built signficant component inventory in December, causing weaker orders to those suppliers in the March quarter. We believe recent supply chain data points are explained by timing and that the December + March quarter production plans are relatively unchanged from two months ago. Our view that iPhone demand is intact is supported by Hon Hai's recent December month revenue beat of 48% (see report here). On the back of the supply chain noise, we believe investors now expect March quarter guidance that implies 55-60M iPhone units compared to current sell-side consensus of 62M. We believe both buy- and sell-side consensus are unreasonable in light of current March quarter iPhone build plans of 64M, according to MS Greater China Technology Hardware analyst Sharon Shih. Furthermore, Apple typically beats the supply chain builds by 18%, on average, over the past five years suggesting reported iPhone units could be meaningfully higher than 64M (Exhibit 9). We believe strength of iPhone X and discounted older model iPhones in China are most misunderstood by investors and help explain our out of consensus bullish view. We model FY18 Apple 6072 revenue and EPS of $307B and $13.00, 12% and 13% above consensus. 6083"

Importantly, the data through November 19 only contains 16 days of iPhone X availability, whereas the comparable period for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus includes a full 28 days. As a result, we expect further acceleration of iPhone X relative to iPhone 8/8 Plus in the next data release. iPhone X data show runway for iPhone upgrades. Despite faster penetration of iPhone X vs. iPhone 8/8 Plus, we believe there remains significant pent-up demand from the base of 2+ year old iPhone owners. This is because 48% of upgraders to iPhone X upgraded from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (Exhibit 3), meaning early adopters are driving demand at the beginning of the cycle. Compare this to upgrader data for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus (Exhibit 4) that show 43% and 46% of upgraders, respectively, in the November 19 period, came from the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus generation. As a result, we believe upgrades to the iPhone X from the base of 2-year-old iPhone owners, which is up 56% Y/Y entering this supercycle (Exhibit 5), aren't yet captured and provide a runway for   Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with continued iPhone X growth over the next two quarters.

For analyst certification and other important disclosures, Switching rates to Apple accelerating. The net switching rate to Apple, or           refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this percentage of non-iPhone smartphone owners that switched to an iPhone minus          report. 6351 the percentage of iPhone owners that switched away to a different smartphone brand, accelerated 130bps in the four-week period ending November 19, to 9.2% (Exhibit 7). This positive inflection coincides with the first period of data that captures more than two days of iPhone X availability. In addition, the only other smartphone brand in China that had a positive switching rate in the latest four- week period was Vivo, with all other brands ceding share. Importantly, a recent report from Digitimes also points to Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo cutting smartphone orders by over 10% as ""demand has become weaker than expected recently, which has also resulted in rising inventories at channels."" We believe that these early data points corroborate our survey work from 2016 that shows Chinese- branded smartphone owners are more willing to upgrade to Apple this cycle than stay with their existing China smartphone brand (Exhibit 8). Faster iPhone X adoption + increasing switching rate = Accelerating iPhone share gains. Ultimately, these data points show that faster iPhone X penetration, coupled with increasing switching rates to Apple, have accelerated market share gains for the iPhone in China. In the last six months, Apple's period-over-period active smartphone market share gains have averaged 1.4bps. In the two four- week periods that contain partial iPhone X shipment data, however, share gains averaged 87.1bps, driving iPhone market share to 21.2% (Exhibit 9). As supply of iPhone X continues to ramp into the end of the year and new data sets include a full four weeks of data with iPhone X availability, we expect share gains to increase further. Google Trends data corroborate bullish outlook for iPhone X in China. As you can see in Exhibit 10, weighted Google search trends by region point to higher searches for iPhone in China than any other region and an accelerating rate of searches in C4Q17, greater than the acceleration in 4Q14 after the iPhone 6 launch. While search data reflect interest, not necessarily purchases, the combination of strong searches and share gains within the active user base is bullish, in our view. We continue to believe that China will be the primary driver of iPhone growth in FY18 and model 74M iPhone shipments in FY18, up 80% Y/Y. And with consensus FY18 iPhone shipments still at 242M, China has the potential to account for all of the incremental iPhones modeled by consensus this fiscal year. Additionally, rising ASPs, margin contribution from the weaker dollar and NAND prices, and the combination of a lower tax rate and cash repatriation provide support for upward revisions to consensus EPS in the coming quarters. Our FY18 EPS of $13 is 13.4% above consensus (of $11.46) and we see shares moving higher over the next two quarters. Recent AAPL stock performance trails past supercycles (Exhibit 11), implying there is still significant room for Apple shares to run as China, ASP, margin, and tax reform catalysts play out. 6362 Exhibits Exhibit 1: Despite IDC shipment data pointing to Apple losing smartphone share in China, data on active smartphone market share in China shows Apple gaining share.

At the same time, local Chinese brands Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi gained share of China smartphone shipments over the same period - from 42% to 65% (Exhibit 4). We believe share of active phones, which is growing, better reflects Apple's position in China. We've partnered with our AlphaWise colleagues to analyze data from Jiguang, a firm that aggregates smartphone data from its push- messaging services in China, that shows Apple actually leads in share of the active smartphone user base in China (or ""installed base"") as of October 22, 2017. In fact, Apple gained over 400bps of market share of the active user base in China this year, to 19.5%, ahead of market share gains (and losses) from the largest four incumbent Chinese smartphone brands (Exhibit 5). How do we explain this divergence in shipment and active user data? First off, it's important to delineate that smartphone shipments are reported on a sell-in         Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a basis, and over the last 12 months we've read reports (here) and heard from             result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a component suppliers that have highlighted that Chinese smartphone vendors               conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider have been building meaningful channel inventory of inactivated smartphones.             Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making More importantly in our view, Chinese-branded smartphones have a shorter                their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, replacement cycle vs. Apple, suggesting they have to sell more phones to achieve        refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this the same share of activated smartphones. We believe the more accurate                   report. 6701 indicator of vendor strength and potential upgrade demand in China is active smartphone market share, where Apple gained leading up to the iPhone 8/X launch (Exhibit 6). China smartphone data also highlights pent-up demand and switching opportunity for iPhone. We believe Chinese consumers are especially sensitive to new technology and form factor changes. This is the first time Apple stretched a form factor three years, creating pent-up demand, especially in China. The Jiguang data confirms this dynamic, as over 75% of the active iPhone base is two generations or older (Exhibit 7). For comparison, our recent US smartphone survey pointed to 63% of respondents owning a 2+ year old iPhone in the US. Additionally, we see the largest cohort of iPhone upgraders to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in the 4 weeks through October 22nd have upgraded from the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (Exhibit 8), which further highlights the pent up demand in China. The Jigaung data also highlights that in the 4 weeks ending October 22nd, more ""switchers"" left their Chinese branded smartphone for an iPhone than iPhone users left for a Chinese branded smartphone, across all local vendors (Exhibit 9). In fact, Apple's net switching rate, or the net amount of switchers gained/lost as a percentage of all brand switchers increased to 7.6% in the latest 4 week period, up from 6.7% in the prior 4 week period ending October 8th. Comparatively, Vivo was the only Chinese smartphone vendor to gain ""net switchers"", albeit at a significantly lower rate (Exhibit 10). We expect this trend to only accelerate as future data sets will include the period after the iPhone X first began shipping. Mix of larger display iPhone models continues to increase; positive for ASP growth. Over the last 12 months, the mix of Plus model iPhone shipments in China rose (Exhibit 11) as consumer preferences shifted to larger displays and Apple's iPhone portfolio re-oriented to plus-sized models. This is an important driver of ASP growth, especially considering this year's Plus models are priced, on average, 19% higher than their smaller model counterpart. This trend is borne out in the Jiguang data as well, with the mix of ""Plus"" models as a % of the active iPhone base in China increasing 600bps YTD, to 40.4% (Exhibit 12). With reports of stronger demand for the iPhone 8 Plus vs. the iPhone 8 (IT Hardware: What We Learned in Asia), the continued rollout of the iPhone X, and purchase intentions in China that are much more skewed to the iPhone 8 Plus and X vs. the iPhone 8 (Exhibit 13), we expect meaningful uplift to iPhone ASPs in FY18 and forecast a 22% Y/Y increase in ASPs to $796. Growth in the active smartphone base in China supports strong Apple Services growth. According to data from Sensor Tower, Apple's App Store generated over $4B in revenue from China YTD, which we largely attribute to growth of the active iPhone user base in China. In fact, plotting monthly App Store revenue in China with Jiguang iPhone market share data through the first 9 months of this year points to a correlation of 0.82 with an r-squared of 0.67 (Exhibit 14). To the extent we see an acceleration in smartphone market share gains, we would expect App Store revenue growth in China to accelerate, potentially boosted further by new Augmented Reality applications. Bringing it all together: We remain very bullish on Apple's prospects in China. Even after recent smartphone user base share gains, we believe that Apple is just turning the corner in China and growth will meaningfully accelerate in the quarters to come (Exhibit 15), due to a litany of factors such as 1) easier 6712 compares, 2) pent up demand for a revolutionary new iPhone, 3) a meaningfully larger base of aged iPhones ripe for an upgrade, 4) non-Apple smartphone owners that have already begun switching to iPhone, 5) growth in iPhone ASPs from positive mix shift and 6) growth of the overall Apple ecosystem in China that will continue to drive higher services revenue. If we are correct, then we believe China could grow over 70% and account for 25% of Apple revenue in FY18, similar to the last iPhone supercycle in FY15 (and up from 20% in FY17). Additionally, with operating margins that only trail those of Japan (Exhibit 16), growth in China would also put upward pressure on operating margins, all else equal. 6723 Exhibits Exhibit 1: We see the base of 2 year old iPhones up 60% Y/Y entering the iPhone 8/X supercycle Estimated iPhone Upgradeable Base Entering 2016             Entering 2017 80    +6% 70                                                             We continue to believe that 70            +56%          +16%                      China will be the most 60   67                                                        meaningful drivers of iPhone Units (Millions) 58              57                    growth in FY18 50                                                 +19% 49 40 37                                 37 30                                                 31 20                                                                 -4%             +55% 10 7      7         1     2 - North              China         EMEA         APJ       Latin America        India America Source: IDC, AlphaWise, Morgan Stanley Research Exhibit 2: More Oppo and Vivo users would switch to an iPhone vs. repurchasing their current brand, according to our 2016 AlphaWise smartphone survey in China OPPO and Vivo Smartphone Owners: Brand Loyalty Gauge 5% 3%                     Switch to Apple 8% Stay with Current Brand 32% Switch to Samsung 8% Switch to Huawei Switch to Meizu 10% Switch to OPPO 21%                         Switch to Xiaomi 13% Switch to Other Source: AlphaWise, Morgan Stanley Research 6734"

Off-balance sheet commitments are roughly 90% correlated to next quarter revenue (Exhibit 4), implying December quarter sales near $86B relative to company guidance of $84-87B, through revenue typically overshoots this metric in the holiday quarter. We believe Apple is planning for strong demand and making purchase commitments to lock in favorable pricing, especially in memory. (2) Vendor non- trade receivables similarly increased 31% Y/Y, however this reflects a modest deceleration from 40% Y/Y growth in the June quarter. This metric represents components purchased by Apple and transferred to manufacturing partners. These receivables have 83% correlati-on to next quarter revenue (Exhibit 5), and similarly support management revenue guidance. (3) Inventory held on Apple's balance sheet grew to $4.9B in the September quarter, up 54% Q/Q and 128% Y/Y and a record high for the company. We believe the inventory increase is a combination of pre-purchases and the rising value of components, namely memory, where prices increased over 100% and 50% Y/Y for DRAM and NAND,                  Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with respectively (Exhibit 6).                                                                companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a Normalized September gross margin weaker than reported due to rising memory              conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider costs. We calculate normalized September gross margin of 36.7% after adjusting           Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making for: (1) FX hedging, (2) warranty, (3) non-designated derivatives and (4) Services       their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, one-time adjustment. FX hedge gains boosted gross margin by 10bps, up from a             refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this 50bps drag in the prior year, while warranty expense boosted gross margin by             report. 24 1 only 50bps relative to 70bps a year ago. We calculate the impact of warranty expenses by comparing reported warranty expense to normalized expense based on three year average ratios to hardware revenue. Apple recently began breaking out gains/losses on non-designated derivatives which was a 10bps headwind to September quarter gross margin. Apple doesn't disclose a similar figure a year ago but we assume this is because the impact was insignificant. Adjusting for these first three items, Apple's normalized gross margin of 37.5% fell 40bps Y/Y relative to -10bps Y/Y on a reported basis. Additionally, Apple disclosed a favorable $640M one-time adjustment to Services revenue due to a change in estimate based on the availability of additional supporting information. While the company did not provide detail, we believe this could be tied user/engagement- related payments from third party mobile app providers. Assuming 100% flow through, the one-time Services revenue adjustment boosted reported gross margin by 80bps which implies normalized gross margin, accounting for the impact from 1x Services adjustment, was closer to 36.7% and down 110bps Y/Y (Exhibit 1). Capital expenditure plans increase $1M to $16B in FY18. The company expects to spend $16B in Capex for FY18, up from $14.9B reported in FY17 (Exhibit 8). However, we note FY17 Capex plans initially reflected expectations for $16B but were reduced to $15B in the June quarter 10-Q. FY18 expectations reflect more modest 7% growth in spending Y/Y, following accelerated growth of 16% and 14% Y/Y in FY17 and FY16, respectively - though the completion of Apple's new headquarters is likely a contributing factor to slower Capex growth. Product tooling and manufacturing process equipment is listed first in drivers of increased Capex Y/Y, which we see as another sign of Apple's confidence in the product and services pipeline. Other notable updates in Apple's FY17 10-K include: 1) Apple now has two customers (likely carriers) that each accounted for 10% of total trade receivables compared to one in FY16 and FY15. 2) Apple now has three vendors that represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables (42%, 19% and 10%) up from two at the end of FY16 (accounted for 47% and 21%), reflecting a broader base of manufacturing partners. 3) Apple's direct sales increased to 28% in FY17, up from 25% in FY16, a positive gross margin driver. 25 2 AAPL Risk Reward Upcoming iPhone Supercycle Combined With Increasing Services Mix Makes AAPL Our Top Pick $ 300                                       Investment Thesis $267.00 (+55%)                            Apple has the world's most valuable 250 technology platform with over one billion 200                                                                                                  $200.00 (+16%) active devices, and is best positioned to $172.50                                                                capture more of its users' time in areas such 150                                                                                                                                             as health, autos and home.

Our bottom-up iPhone unit forecast by region points to 268M iPhone shipments in CY18, ahead of consensus forecast of 242M. China is the biggest contributor to 2018 growth, with our bottom up forecast pointing to 74M shipments, an 80% increase from 41M shipments in LTM (through June), as the large base of iPhone 6 owners upgrade to the first major form factor change since late 2014 and Apple takes share from Android (Exhibit 1). Combined with higher than consensus ASPs, we model FY18 Revenue of $307B, 15% above consensus, and EPS of $13.00, 16% above consensus. We see further upside to AAPL shares on the back of positive earnings revisions as iPhone X shipments ramp. Our price target increases slightly to $200 (from $199), driven by 15.4x our FY18e EPS of $13.00. Most important takeaways from the quarter: Recent innovation puts upward pressure on gross margin despite memory, Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with iPhone X production ramp costs. Apple faces a 110bps headwind from higher            companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a memory prices Y/Y in the December quarter, as well as higher iPhone production       result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of ramp costs Y/Y as these costs are spread across the September and December           Morgan Stanley Research.

While visibility is limited, Apple expects NAND and 60 1 DRAM supply/demand to come into balance sometime in 2018. In the meantime, the 54% Q/Q increase in Apple owned inventory largely represents strategic buys of components to meet near-term demand. Emerging market recovery can continue, in our view. The most bullish data point in the quarter was China revenue re-accelerating from a 10% decline in June to 12% growth in September. With easing compares and Chinese consumers waiting for a new form factor to upgrade, we see China growth accelerating through FY18. India revenue also doubled, with iPhones growing double digits and iPad sales up 39% Y/Y, on the back of a larger store, channel and manufacturing presence in country (increasing brand awareness) as well as continued development of telecom infrastructure by local carriers. Emerging markets ex- Greater China grew 40% and with China grew over 20% Y/Y. Services growth accelerated even ex one-time benefit. Adjusted Services revenue grew 24% Y/Y, accelerating from 22% in recent quarters, despite a tougher compare. In the quarter, App Store revenue reached new highs while Apple Music paid subs grew 75% Y/Y, iCloud saw double digit growth in MAU and revenues, and the number of paid subs across Apple's services offering increased to 210M, from 185M last quarter (+14% Q/Q). As reported, Services revenue grew 34%, boosted by a one-time $640M adjustment based on new information from partners. The adjustment happened over multiple Services categories. Given many services - App Store, iCloud, Apple Music - are purchased directly on Apple's platform, we believe the adjustments more likely associate with Support sold through partners and/or TAC-type payments from partners.

Post the           QUARTERLY MODELWARE EPS ($) iPhone launch event last week, we revisit our FY18 product ASP estimates, where                      2017e   2017e                          2018e         2018e we see an across the board uplift due to: 1) starting prices on iPhone 8 and 8 Plus   Quarter  2016   Prior Current                          Prior       Current Q1        3.28      -   3.36a                          3.87          3.91 that are $50 and $30 higher, respectively, than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, 2) iPhone    Q2        1.90      -   2.10a                          3.12          3.45 X starting price of $999 that is $50 above our expectation, 3) increased iPad Pro     Q3        1.42      -   1.67a                          2.36          2.56 prices by $50 in higher-capacity 256GB and 512GB SKUs on the back of elevated         Q4        1.67  1.80     1.82                          2.43          2.65 e = Morgan Stanley Research estimates, a = Actual Company reported data memory component costs, 4) new features in Apple Watch Series 3 (cellular) and Apple TV (4K) that drive prices $30 above prior generations, and 5) an increase to the price of 2-year AppleCare contracts for iPhone by $20+ (Exhibit 1). Taking all of these price changes into account drives our FY18 iPhone ASPs 5% higher to $784 (from $746; Exhibit 7), iPad ASPs to $450 (from $446), Apple Watch ASPs to $401 (from $393) and services revenue higher by an incremental percentage point to account for the higher AppleCare pricing (Exhibit 3). Net net, our FY18 revenue forecast increases to $301B (from $288B) and is now 14% above consensus estimates of $263B. Innovation-led price increases historically boost, rather than hinder, Apple demand. Apple is an aspirational brand offering high quality, innovative products at a premium price. As a result, the company escapes the typical trend of declining prices that drive demand for other devices. In fact, demand for iPhone is directly correlated to the direction of ASPs - higher prices, higher demand and vice versa. We see three recent examples of this phenomenon. First, Apple's           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a strongest iPhone unit growth in the past five years coincided with the largest ASP    result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a uplift, +11% in FY15, with the introduction of the larger screen iPhone 6 Plus.       conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Second, when Apple launched cheaper iPhones, 5c and SE in FY13 and FY16,              Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making demand disappointed and iPhone unit growth decelerated at a faster clip than          their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, any other year (Exhibit 2). Lastly, despite a $20 price increase to help digest       refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this increased costs associated with dual camera technology in the iPhone 7 Plus, the      report. 83 1 product was constrained through the end of CY16. In fact, iPhone ASPs rose 1-2% through F3Q17, boosted by rising iPhone 7 Plus mix, helping to re-accelerate unit demand from the FY16 lows. Loyal customer base and currency tailwind boost confidence higher ASPs won't hurt demand. As the smartphone market matures, Apple loyalty rates are rising. According to our April 2017 AlphaWise US Smartphone survey, Ninety-two percent of US iPhone users who plan to upgrade their phone in the next year plan to repurchase an iPhone, up from 86% the year before (Exhibit 8). Apple also enjoys higher repurchase rates in international markets with an average loyalty rate of 86% compared to 61% for Samsung in those markets. We believe Apple's early lead in Augmented Reality will only push customer loyalty rates higher in coming years. What's more, a weaker US Dollar compared to several international currencies, including Euro (+6% Y/Y), Brazilian Real (+6% Y/Y), Indian Rupee (+4% Y/Y), and Chinese Yuan (+2% Y/Y), helps offset the recent USD price increases in these markets. Slow manufacturing ramp and potential yield constraints on iPhone X push units into the March quarter. The November 3 iPhone X launch date is later than past iPhones, likely a function of a slower manufacturing ramp as the supply chain works to improve yields on new components. To account for a more back- end loaded production ramp in the December quarter, we shift 2M iPhone X units from the December to the March quarter, potentially setting up a seasonally better (less weak) March (Exhibit 10). Net, our December and March quarter shipments of 81M (+3% Y/Y) and 71M (+40% Y/Y), respectively (vs. 83M and 69M prior), translate to unchanged FY18 iPhone shipments of 262M (Exhibit 9), 6% above the current consensus estimate of 247M. China remains a key driver of our above consensus estimates, where the number of iPhones due to be upgraded grew 56% this year setting up for a powerful upgrade cycle (Exhibit 11). Higher ASPs translate to FY18 EPS of $12.60, 15% above consensus; PT to $194 (from $182). In addition to our higher ASP assumptions across iPhone, iPad, Watch, and AppleCare, we raise our FY18 forecast for Apple Watch to 25M units (+39% Y/Y) to reflect our bullish outlook on the Apple Watch Series 3, particularly the cellular enabled model. However, we also lower FY18 gross margins across the device segments to account for further memory market tightness, driving our FY18 company gross margin to 38.3% (down 10bps Y/Y), from 38.6% prior. Together, these changes drive our FY18 revenue and EPS to $301B (from $288B) and $12.60 (from $11.80), 14-15% above current Street estimates, and our price target to $194 (from $182). With our FY18 revenue and EPS estimates meaningfully ahead of consensus and shares trading at 12.6x, compared to the iPhone 6 cycle peak multiple of 15.4x, we continue to believe that a period of accelerated growth as smartphone users upgrade/switch to the first new iPhone form factor in three years is not priced into shares. Apple shares are up 50% YTD compared to the last two upgrade cycles - iPhone 4 and iPhone 6 - when shares rose an average of 142% over the cycle (Exhibit 12). We continue to see bull case valuation of $253 in a scenario of strong consumer adoption of augmented reality apps that extends the iPhone upgrade cycle into FY19 with accelerating services revenue growth in FY19-20 (Global Technology: Can Augmented Reality Drive the Next Big Smartphone Upgrade Cycle?). 84 2 Analysis Exhibit 1: An equal-weighted portfolio of Apple products shows hardware pricing up 1-3% vs. period prior to last week's product event, although actual shipment mix leads to even greater ASP uplift Apple Products: New vs. Old Pricing                                                                        Post-Launch Pricing Pre-Launch Pricing $-                       $200                       $400                      $600            $800 $692 iPhone                                                                                                      $673            +3% $689 iPad                                                                                                                    +2% $672 $326 Apple Watch                                                                          +2% $319 $176 Apple TV                                                   +1% $174 AppleCare for                                   $149 +16% iPhone*                                      $129 Source: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research; *AppleCare for iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will be priced at $149, and at $199 for the iPhone X.

However, the 64GB model is at the more widely reported                           (1-415) 315-6713 $999. The device ships toward the later end of what we expected on November 3 with                      rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com pre-ordering on October 27. As expected, Apple also introduced two new LCD iPhone                       Bloomberg JPMA HALL <GO> 8 models, an LTE capable Apple Watch and a 4K Apple TV.

The device is expected to be available next year. ï‚· No HomePod yet: The HomePod was absent from this event. We believe this likely means yet another event later in the Fall to introduce that product assuming it delivers this year as originally indicated. ï‚· Read across to LITE/VIAV: Apart from availability, the only other read across surprise for us so far was that there was apparently only a single VCSEL array on the device with no iris scanning. There is a proximity sensor but we find it hard to believe that this is a VCSEL array. This may explain why LITEâ€™s content expectation came down to $4 from $5 some time ago. Note that this is consistent with our current model. 2 123"

We believe the strength was driven by the availability of the new low priced iPad during the quarter as well as due to the new 10.5â€ iPad Pro announced at WWDC in June. Apple pointed out success with both enterprises and in the educational channel on the iPad during the quarter. Luca Maestri said that channel inventory on the iPad was within their normal 5-7weeks. We believe that there was likely a buildup in iPad channel inventory during the quarter as the weeks of inventory increased to â€˜withinâ€™ the normal range in FQ3 from â€˜belowâ€™ the normal range in FQ2. We are expecting iPad strength to continue and potentially intensify as iOS 11 makes the product more capable of fully replacing a laptop for many people in our opinion.

Seasonal GM decline lower Appleâ€™s overall gross margin dropped just 30bps from FQ2 this year compared to 110bps and 130bps respectively in 2015 and 2016. Part of this was likely due to the 3pp increase in high margin Services revenue as a percentage of the total. However, we also believe that lower commodities prices ex memory drove the better trajectory. We note that this could be interesting this Fall as many expect memory pricing to pressure margins while the potential offsetting positive effect of other commodities is not well understand or researched. 3 168"

Apple reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.3M, more than 2x the three-year June quarter average, which represents an incremental $1.4B, or 3%. Even with the channel inventory headwind, revenue growth accelerated to 7%, from 5% in the prior quarter, and grew across all key product categories - iPhone (+3%), iPad (+2%), Mac (+7%), Services (+22%) and Other (+23%; includes Watch, AirPods and accessories). iPhone Supercycle on track for a fall launch. Despite investor concerns that OLED iPhone shipments could push to Nov/Dec or even next year, management guided September quarter bullishly and sounded confident on upcoming product launches this fall. We increase our September quarter iPhone unit shipment estimate by 6M to 43M units, in part due to higher overall demand but also due to some of the new products likely contributing later in the quarter. As a result, we pull forward 4M units from our FY18 forecast and now model 262M unit shipments in FY18, ~10% above consensus estimates. We'd also highlight that vendor non-trade receivables are up more than seasonal (+13% Q/Q vs. trailing         Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

While          result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a management didn't comment specifically on details of the iPhone launch, Tim           conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Cook's excitement around AR (Augmented Reality) use cases and Apple's large           Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making installed base of AR capable devices with the launch of iOS11 is supportive of our    their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, supercycle thesis. Much like dual camera a year ago, Apple will be the first to       refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this incorporate 3D sensors into the iPhone, which combined with the recently              report. 1851 announced ARKit for developers sets the company up to take outsized share of smartphone upgrades if these applications resonate with consumer and business users. Gross margin story intact despite rising component costs. The combination of leverage on higher revenues, increasing services mix (16% of total revenue, highest quarterly total ever), and increasing services margin offset higher memory costs in the June quarter. Heading into the fall iPhone launch, we're increasingly convinced Apple can pass on higher component costs associated with new technologies making our 80bps iPhone GM decline in FY18 look conservative. All else equal, a flat iPhone GM adds $0.22 to our $11.80 FY18 EPS forecast. China recovery supports supercycle thesis. The number of aged iPhones in China that are due for an upgrade grew 56% this year setting up for accelerating upgrades when a new iPhone form factor launches this fall. What's more, the switching opportunity is ripe in China. Roughly one-third of Chinese smartphone brand users (Vivo, Oppo) intend to consider an iPhone upon upgrade while only twenty percent are loyal to their existing provider. The combination of these factors drive our 66% bottom up China iPhone unit growth forecast in FY18. Revenue in mainland China grew 6% at constant currency in June and while Greater China revenue declined 10% as reported (less at constant currency), it was a modest improvement from -13% in the first half of the year. What's more, consistent growth across the Apple ecosystem - iPads, Macs, Services - suggests the recent iPhone weakness (flat in the June quarter) will reverse when a new product becomes available. 1862"

Increasing evidence OLED iPhone launches in October, rather than September. In light of the most meaningful feature and technology upgrades in iPhone's history - including OLED displays, wireless charging, and 3D sensors for AR - we believe it's reasonable to assume the new, higher priced OLED iPhone ships in October rather than September. This is consistent with supplier checks by the Morgan Stanley Greater China Technology Hardware team, led by Sharon Shih, as published in the July Monthly Databook. Our view of demand over the course of the next iPhone cycle is unchanged with the 6M lower September shipments now incorporated in our FY18 iPhone forecast of 266M (up from 260M) which aligns with our recent bottom-up analysis of upgrades, retention rate, and switchers by region (Exhibit 1). Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with Our new forecast reflects better Dec and Mar quarter seasonality, on par with       companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a 4s cycle. We view iPhone 4s as the best guide for seasonality during the iPhone 8   result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of supercycle as it is the only other time a new iPhone shipped in October (Exhibit    Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider 4). During that cycle, iPhone shipments declined 16% Q/Q in September which         Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their investment decision. matches closely with the lowered, -18% Q/Q sell-in forecast by our China            For analyst certification and other important disclosures, Hardware team. Similarly, December 2011 iPhone shipments increased 117%, well       refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this report. above prior three year seasonality of 72%, and initial December 2017 build 2591 forecast aligns with this trend, at +169% Q/Q. What's more, March 2012 marked the best ever iPhone shipment seasonality (-5% Q/Q) and we see potential for a similar dynamic this cycle. As a result of more iPhone shipments pushed to FY18, our ASP and total company GM also decrease in September but increase next year (Exhibit 5 & Exhibit 6) AAPL shares don't yet price in supercycle. With our FY18 EPS 11% ahead of consensus and shares trading 12.6x compared to the iPhone 6 cycle peak multiple of 15.4x, we don't believe a period of accelerated growth as smartphone users upgrade / switch to the first new iPhone form factor in three years is priced in. What's more, the last two periods of meaningful iPhone growth acceleration (iPhone 4 in 2010-11 and iPhone 6 in 2014-15) produced elongated periods of significant share outperformance (Exhibit 7), well ahead of recent performance. Also interesting is that the most exaggerated period of outperformance came in the months after 4s launched later than usual, in October 2011 (Exhibit 8). 2602 Analysis Exhibit 1: Delayed iPhone launch shifts 6M iPhone Units from Sept (F4Q17) to FY18 iPhone Units (M)                                        MS - Old                                           MS - New 6M iPhones Shift from Sept Q to FY18 90                                                                                    84 84 78 78 80 68 70 70 60                                                                                                                    54 55             54 57 51 51 50                                               41 41         43 40                                                                    37 30 20 10 0 1Q17A         2Q17A                3Q17           4Q17                  1Q18          2Q18                  3Q18           4Q18 Source: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research Exhibit 2: Our FY18 EPS increases to $11.80 to reflect higher iPhone and iPad shipments FY17                                                                    FY18 MS-New            MS-Old            Cons       MS vs Cons              MS-New            MS-Old             Cons        MS vs Cons Total Revenue         $ 220,347 $ 223,505 $ 226,465                              -3%          $ 287,024 $ 277,827 $ 254,029                               13% Y/Y Growth                 2.2%      3.6%      5.0%                              -3%              30.3%     24.3%     12.2%                               18% Gross Margin              38.1%     38.2%     38.5%                            -0.4%              38.6%     38.4%     38.8%                             -0.2% EPS                   $    8.52 $    8.64 $    8.92                              -4%          $   11.80 $   11.50 $   10.60                               11% Y/Y Growth                 2.5%      4.0%      7.4%                              -5%              38.5%     33.1%     18.8%                               20% iPhone Revenue        $ 135,033 $ 140,097 $ 143,451                                -6%        $ 197,991 $ 192,699 $ 162,257                                22% Y/Y Growth                 -1.2%     2.5%      4.9%                                -6%            46.6%     37.5%     13.1%                                34% iPhone Units             207,053   213,053   217,130                               -5%           266,000   260,000   237,913                               12% Y/Y Growth                 -2.3%     0.6%      2.5%                                -5%            28.5%     22.0%      9.6%                                19% iPhone ASP            $      651 $    656 $     661                                -2%        $     747 $     743 $     682                                10% iPad Revenue          $   18,881 $         16,755          NA               NA                $   16,167 $        12,051           NA                 NA Y/Y Growth                  -8.5%          -18.8%                                                 -14.4%          -28.1% iPad Units                 42,003           37,503                                                 35,500          26,500 Y/Y Growth                  -7.9%          -17.7%                                                 -15.5%          -29.3% iPad ASP              $       454 $           450                                             $      459 $           457 Source: Company Data, ThomsonReuters, Morgan Stanley Research Exhibit 3: We look for better than seasonal and above consensus December and March quarter iPhone growth...

On the AR front, Apple introduced and gave live demos of the new ARKit, a tool that will give app developers the capability to create new AR/VR-focused apps in the future. Ultimately, we believe the heightened AI/ML and AR/VR focus of the new operating systems will help the 16M strong developer community drive greater app development ahead of the anticipated 10th anniversary iPhone, which will expand iPhone user spend, improve customer stickiness and drive the 19% Y/Y services growth required to hit the company's target of doubling Services revenue by 2020.

Powered by Siri and Apple's A8 chip, the       report. 3541 HomePod features spatial awareness (it can adjust audio based on where it's placed), advanced AI-centric home assistant capabilities and advanced privacy settings. Given that Apple customers are more likely to own an Amazon Echo or Alexa-powered device than the average consumer, we believe the HomePod will broaden the Apple ecosystem over time, however, the product will not be launched in the US until December 2017, with broader distribution expected in 2018. Apple highlighted 14 different use cases for the Siri home assistant, such as playing music, accessing news, messages, reminders, weather & traffic, and controlling HomeKit devices, and the added benefit of accessing Apple Music's 40M streaming songs and 2M artists provides a solid base of use, but the key to adoption will ultimately be how powerful the Siri-driven AI capabilities of the HomePod will be vs. the Amazon Echo, and how quickly Apple can ramp global production. New 10.5"" iPad and updates to the iMac and MacBooks with iMac Pro expected later this year. As was rumored prior to the event, Apple introduced a new 10.5"" iPad Pro, which will run on the new iOS 11 (with iPad focused enhancements) and offers improved display performance, faster processing and graphics power (driven by A10X Fusion Chip), a 10 hour battery life and noticeably improved memory options starting at 64GB (vs. 32GB in older models), with availability of 256GB and 512GB options as well. On the Mac side, Apple announced a refresh to both their desktop and notebook lines, with the biggest improvement coming from the integration of the new Intel Kaby Lake processors. Finally, Apple gave a sneak peak of the $4,999 iMac Pro, with up to 18 core Xeon processing power, AMD Radeon Vega graphics architecture, and core use cases of real time 3D rendering, AR/VR, machine learning development and fast code compiling. Other important OS announcements. Apple also used the Keynote at WWDC to introduce Apple Pay for Peer-to-Peer payments, which can be used through the iMessages App and will compete directly with Venmo, Square and other P2P payment services. Additionally, the company announced that by year end, Apple Pay will be in over 50% of US retailers. In regards to Apple Music, the company announced they now have more than 27M subscribers, up from ""well past 20M"" as of mid-Feb 2017 and 20M as of December 2016. Lastly, Apple announced the much anticipated integration of Amazon Prime Video with tvOS. 3552"

Apple is the only material share 3961 gainer, according to our survey. Bottom-up iPhone supercycle analysis now points to upside to our 260M FY18 shipment estimate. Accounting for the new survey data, our North America bottom-up iPhone supercycle analysis, which uses survey-driven retention and switching rates combined with our estimated upgradeable base by vendor, now points to 72M shipments vs. our prior 70M estimate (Exhibit 6). With our estimates for the rest of the world unchanged, the increase in our North America estimate drives our bottom-up Global iPhone upgrade forecast to 266M units vs. 264M prior (Exhibit 7). While we maintain our FY18 unit/ASP estimates of 260M and $743 (both 9-10% above cons), the upside implied by the new survey data makes even our above consensus estimates look conservative. With F2Q earnings behind us, focus shifts back to supercycle expectations. With F2Q results and guidance that were better than most feared, we believe investor attention has now turned back to the iPhone supercycle, especially in light of Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledging on the F2Q earnings call in early May that he is seeing a pause in consumer purchases of iPhones due to ""more frequent reports about future iPhones."" Recent reports on low yields for new components that could affect the 10th anniversary iPhone launch have caused investor concern, although Morgan Stanley's Greater China Technology Research colleagues have not yet seen delays in the supply chain and still expect new iPhone production to start on time for most of the components (including OLED). Nevertheless, we remain conservative in our initial expectations for iPhone supply, and forecast unit growth of only 3% in C2H17, well below the implied 20- 30% growth based on current build forecasts. Raise target multiple to 15.4x, in line with the high-end of the peak during the iPhone 6 supercycle, driving PT to $177 (from $161). Given growing confidence in our FY18 supercycle estimates along with a greater mix of recurring, high-margin services revenue, larger cash balance with potential for repatriation, and the potential for a more elongated upgrade cycle, we believe that Apple shares should trade at a 15x-plus P/E (vs. 14x prior), which is the high end of the peak during the iPhone 6 supercycle (Exhibit 1). With our FY18 estimates unchanged, this drives our price target to $177, for 14% upside from current prices. We also increase our bull case to $203 (from $190). Ultimately, we continue to believe consensus estimates for FY18 iPhone shipments of 237M and iPhone ASP of $682, essentially flat with the last two quarters, are far too low (Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9). We model FY18 revenue and EPS 10-11% above consensus (Exhibit 10 and Exhibit 11) and see positive estimate revisions over the next two quarters driving shares higher.

FX hedge gains offset by higher warranty expense and other derivative losses. FX hedge gains boosted gross margin by 160bps, up from an 80bps benefit in the prior year. This gain was offset by a 70bps Y/Y headwind from warranty expense which we calculate by comparing reported warranty expense to normalized expense based on three year average ratios to hardware revenue. Adjusting for these two items, Apple's 37.5% normalized gross margin fell a similar 50bps as the reported gross margin. Additionally, Apple recently began breaking out gains/losses on non-designated derivatives which was a 40bps headwind to March quarter gross margin compared to a 20bps tailwind in the prior quarter. Apple doesn't disclose a similar figure a year ago but assuming this is because the   Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with impact was insignficant, then normalized gross margin was closer to flat Y/Y          companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Although Apple has been aggressive relative to other royalty negotiators, we believe Qualcomm would hurt themselves more than they would help with Draconian measures like an ITC trade injunction against Apple. Not only would this likely push Apple further into the arms of Intel for baseband chips but it would deprive Qualcomm of chip revenues for lost iPhone sales in the US. Outside of the US market similar trade aggression is also possible but the negative outcomes for Qualcomm are equally self destructive in our opinion. This is not to say that such measures are impossible but we believe they are relatively improbable at this stage in the negotiations. To put numbers to Qualcommâ€™s chip exposure to Apple we estimate annual revenue exposure this coming fiscal year from the Decâ€™17 QTR to the Septâ€™18 QTR to be ~$1.3bn or 6% of Qualcommâ€™s total revenue. We calculate that this represents a relatively small 3% of total EBT for Qualcomm. However, we would also note that Apple volumes are a large chunk of TSMC capacity utilization for Qualcomm. Losing those volumes would likely have both short and long term impacts on QCOMâ€™s economics at TSMC in our opinion. Strong gross margins despite headwinds FQ2 gross margins grew 50bps Q/Q to 39.3% despite a lower revenue base, Q/Q FX headwind of 100bps and rising memory prices. Management said this was driven by good cost performance on other commodities and the rising services mix. We are forecasting a typical drop in gross margins to 38.6% for the June quarter as Apple experiences its lowest business quarter of the year.

Finally, stronger than expected June quarter gross margin guidance, at least relative to buy-side expectations, removes the biggest near- term concern and suggests the company is offsetting higher memory prices with price cuts on other components as well as rising services mix. Why did the stock trade down post close? Importantly, we expect investors to buy any pullback in share price tomorrow given the bullish tone and better than expected margin guidance. The March quarter was largely in-line but we heard three areas of minor pushback, all of which can be largely explained: 1) iPhone units declined as reported. However, sell out was up slightly Y/Y (+1%) when adjusted for 1.2M inventory digestion. 2) Revenue in China continues to decline but is largely attributed to delays ahead of a iPhone new form factor, weak demand from Hong Kong tourism, and weak demand at lower end iPhone price points, which a discounted iPhone 7 Plus this fall may address. 3) Services revenue missed our forecast. However, the strongest week of the year (between        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a Christmas and New Year's) fell in the December '16 quarter this fiscal year versus   result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a the March '16 quarter in the prior holiday season.

Our bottom's up and top down global upgrade analyses point to 260M iPhone shipments in FY18, primarily driven by growth in China, which we estimate is 8% above consensus estimates of 242M. Combined with our ASP estimate of $743, which is 10% above consensus and reflects an OLED mix of ~50%, and services growth of 19%, drives our FY18e EPS to $11.50, 12% above current consensus ests of $10.28. Our base case assumes a 14x P/E multiple, which is in-line with where shares traded ahead of the iPhone 6 supercycle, and drives our unchanged $161 price target. However, we see an increasing likelihood of our $190 bull case, based on 15x $12.70 FY18e EPS, playing out in light of new technologies down the iPhone portfolio and extending the upgrade cycle into FY19 as well as increasing high margin services mix and potential tax reform/cash repatriation. 4722"

We maintain our 260M FY18 iPhone forecast and see significant upside in the bull case. Recent supply chain data points indicate investor concerns around low yields for new components that could restrict supply of the new high-end form factor during the September and December quarters of this year. However, our model already bakes in supply constraints with C2H17 iPhone unit growth of 4% well below the implied 20-30% growth based on current build forecasts. What's more, even in a scenario of extreme supply shortage, strong demand is likely to limit valuation downside and could actually extend most investors' holding periods. iPhone ASP assumptions also too low. The combination of higher than expected iPhone 7 Plus mix and improving supply chain clarity on OLED supply to Apple        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a raises our view of ASPs in both the March quarter and through FY18. Back in         result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a November, our checks pointed to 50M OLED panel supply to Apple but the              conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider range has expanded to 50-100M with production yields at Samsung the key             Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making variable. With an expected C2H17 total iPhone production plan of 100-110M, this     their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, suggests OLED could be closer to 50% mix, versus our prior conservative             refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this assumption of 33%. As a result, we raise our FY18 iPhone ASP to $753 (up from       report. 23 1 $713), which compares to consensus of $675. Net, our more bullish iPhone unit and ASP outlook drives FY18 revenue and EPS 12% above current consensus and pushes our PT to $161 (from $154) based on the same 14x P/E which is around where shares peaked during the iPhone 6 cycle. Steady supply chain and demand data points clear path to supercycle. Current iPhone production forecast, as published by Morgan Stanley's Greater China Hardware team, reflects C1H17 29% below C2H16, which is better than prior year trend of -34% H/H. We believe this is a function of Apple managing tight iPhone channel inventory ahead of a major high-end form factor change. Morgan Stanley's AlphaWise tracker, which compiles sell-through data using web search analysis, indicates 60M unit demand for the March quarter. Historically, our Tracker has been accurate directionally, though we think the magnitude of the iPhone demand upside this quarter is likely overstated, and attribute some of the upside to elevated search interest in anticipation of the 10th anniversary iPhone launch. Net, we maintain our 51M March quarter iPhone forecast, roughly in-line with consensus, raise March Q ASP 2% to $675, and see the company reporting revenue at the upper end of the $51.5B to $53.5B range (our new estimate is $52.9B, up from $52.2B). We continue to expect a 38.9% gross margin, at the upper end of 38-39% guidance range, and EPS of $2.03, in line with consensus. Expect typically conservative June quarter guidance. We model June quarter iPhone units declining 22% Q/Q, slightly more than last year to reflect potential for delayed purchases ahead of the September iPhone launch. As is typical, with the exception of the last two quarters of strong guides post a period of channel inventory correction, we expect the June quarter revenue guidance mid-point to come in below current consensus. We currently model $43.2B June Q revenue, below consensus of $45.6B. Our June EPS of $1.45 is also below consensus of $1.62. We lower June quarter gross margin by 70 bps, to 37.8%, to better reflect higher memory costs, and we view company commentary around how much higher commodity costs will impact margins as the main guidance wild card. We view 37.5-38% as the gross margin guidance bogey to keep the stock on its upward trajectory as buy-side expectations seem to be lower than the sell-side consensus of 38.3% in June. However, we do note Apple appears to have pre- purchased more components this year, as we highlighted from the last 10Q filing, which should help minimize memory headwinds relative to competitors. At the end of the day, we don't expect June quarter guidance to be meaningfully more conservative than in the past (on average, revenue guide is 2% lower, gross margin 30bps lower than consensus) and weakness the quarter prior to a major form factor change is to be expected. We expect Apple to increase its dividend and stock buybacks along with earnings. Long term, we see Apple returning its fully taxed FCF assuming existing tax policies globally. Based on this philosophy and historical trends, we model a 10% increase in dividends per share to $0.64. We further model $30B of stock buybacks over the next year. This means Apple will likely raise cumulative buyback authorization from $175B to at least $210B. We see potential for higher cash return, mainly through buybacks, as we gain clarity on cash repatriation, which could add $0.60 to EPS annually. A lower tax rate could add another $1.00-1.50 in our estimation. Building upon our Global upgrade analysis, we have created an interactive model that allows investors to adjust the assumptions we use in both our top down and 24 2 bottom up analyses, across the six geographic regions as defined by IDC, to come to their own iPhone unit conclusions. In our top down analysis, key variables that can be adjusted are; length of replacement cycle, iPhone retention rate and the ratio of shipments as a % of estimated upgraders. We have two versions of our bottoms up analysis - one that allows you to adjust replacement cycle length, iPhone retention rate and the switching rate for all other brands, and one that is more detailed and allows you to adjust replacement cycle length, iPhone retention rate and the switching rate for each of the largest vendors (as well as all smaller vendors collectively).

Our central case is for growth of 17% to 260m units assuming Apple uses pricing to limit demand somewhat and elongate the cycle. A more bullish scenario results in 275m shipments and 24% Y/Y growth in FY18 with our bear case coming in at 11% growth to 245m units. As we explain later in this report we also see constrained OLED supply as a key factor keeping a lid on unit volumes this cycle. We believe Appleâ€™s main challenge is not selling enough phones but rather controlling demand to adequately beat Street expectations while not running past supply capability for too long and leaving something on the table for FY19 when we expect less change in the iPhone product. iPhone Base at 1.14bn heading into this cycle Based on our iPhone Base model, we estimate the global iPhone user base to grow to ~1.14bn by the end of CQ3â€™17, up from 542m heading into the big iPhone6 cycle at the end of CQ3â€™14. In Figure 2 below we show our estimates of iPhone user base growth over time. We estimate that first-time iPhone owners will make up 57% of the total base at the end of CQ3â€™17 heading into this next cycle, and we base most of our replacement assumptions on that, more limited, base of users.

Morgan estimates. We note the increasing divergence between total base and first-time owners in Figure 1 above as refurbs and hand-me-down phones make up a larger and larger part of the overall user base. This high propensity for iPhones to survive in the market beyond their first owner is a positive for Apple in our opinion, but we exclude it from our replacement calculations in order to be conservative in our estimates. 2 97 Rod Hall, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-415) 315-6713          26 March 2017 rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com Device age distribution of the iPhone base We estimate that the average age of a first-time iPhone owner at the end of CQ3 of this year will be 1.61 years (or 6.43 quarters) which compares to 1.58 years (or 6.33 quarters) heading into the large iPhone 6 cycle and to 1.56 years (or 6.23 quarters) last year in CQ3. This slightly high base age combined with a much larger absolute base and a new form/feature set is what drives our model this year. In Figure 2 below we illustrate a forecast boost in the replacement rate to 48%, though we note this is lower than the 58% seen in FY15 given the impact of entry into China in FY15.

Morgan estimates. Late 2016 demand not as good as the headlines One of the reasons we see this increased overall base age is what we believe was an organic decline in underlying demand in CQ4â€™16. To begin with, weekly unit volumes were only flat Y/Y after accounting for an additional week of business in the quarter. In addition to this we believe that earlier than typical launch in 28 countries likely added another ~1m units to Appleâ€™s sales that were not comparable to 2015. Samsungâ€™s GN7 exploding battery problems also may have contributed another 1-2m units to Apple that were, effectively, one-off in nature. All of this adds up to a decidedly lackluster iPhone cycle in late 2016 despite all the popular pronouncements of â€œrecordâ€ iPhone sales. Detailed Shipment Estimates In this section we break out our shipment scenarios by new adoptions, replacements, and with some regional analysis to show how we account for differences like the large penetration gains in China in 2015. Our central case shipment model forecasts 260m iPhone units of sell-through in FY18. This is composed of 202m replacements and 50m adoptions as well as an industry normal 3% loss/breakage rate as is detailed in Table 1 below.

From this you can see that a fairly wide range of possibilities exist including sell-through numbers as high as 290m units.

Morgan estimates. In our most bullish case, we are assuming that iPhone adoptions will decline by 23.5% Y/Y to 50m units, following a 20% Y/Y decline in FY17. In this bull case we are assuming a replacement rate (as % of 1-3r old base) of 52%, up from 40% in FY17. In our central case we assume that adoptions decline by 32% Y/Y and a replacement rate of ~48%. In our worst case, we are assuming adoptions decline by 40.5% Y/Y and what we believe is a low replacement rate of 46%. Note that our worst case replacement rate and adoption assumptions are well below the levels seen during the iPhone 6/6+ cycle, which we believe is very conservative. Important to consider China in replacement analysis Our central case replacement iPhone estimate for FY18 is 202m units, assuming a 48% replacement rate for iPhones 1-3 years old compared to about 58% during the iPhone 6/6+ cycle. We note that the iPhone 6/6+ cycle was helped by low iPhone penetration in China. We therefore break out our central case assumptions by region to illustrate the lower assumed rate of replacement we have assumed for China compared to FY15, which was the year the iPhone was introduced in that country.

A light source bounces off of the object to be scanned and is then detected by a light sensor. To scan in 3D the sensor needs to measure the time of flight of the light as well as the image itself. With all of that data, complex processing algorithms are used to render a 3D â€œimageâ€ that can then be used for facial recognition as well as other applications. In this section we provide more detail on these functions. 1. Light Source: The light emitter (laser diode or infrared LED) emits from the light source toward a target object, while the object reflects the light (photons) back to the image sensor. In the case of the new iPhone sensor we believe this source is an array of semiconductor lasers called VCSELs (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser, pronounced â€œvixelâ€). It is also worth noting that these VCSELs emit light in a specific infrared frequency. 2. Light Filter: To obtain a noise-free scan, a filter is used to eliminate any light not at the specific frequency being emitted. This filter must eliminate stray light noise from all angles, which is harder to do than it sounds given prismatic effects, etc. 3. Image Sensor: The image sensor then determines when the light arrives and at what intensity level. Arrival time or â€œtime of flightâ€ provides the 3D depth information. For the purposes of a pure 3D scan returning a surface shape the intensity information is not technically needed but might be used to otherwise enhance the processed image. 4. Processor IC: The processor IC executes sophisticated algorithms to decipher the received patterns and produces a VGA size depth image of the scene. This depth image can then be compared to a stored facial scan like a fingerprint or, eventually, used for other applications. 2 156 Rod Hall, CFA                            North America Equity Research (1-415) 315-6713                         14 February 2017 rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com Figure 1: PrimeSense 3D sensing technology Source: PrimeSense. Known technology challenges The following is a summary of technology challenges we believe exist based on our discussions with contacts. ï‚· Ambient or background illumination (noise)â€”Ambient light (such as sunlight) may provide uncorrelated photons. Specialized filter technology can be employed to partially eliminate this, though some stray light in the specific infrared frequency being used is always a possibility. ï‚· Optical crosstalk from cover glass/plasticâ€”The devicesâ€™ cover glass/plastic may lead to optical crosstalk (noise). This makes the sensor always receive two targetsâ€”one reflection from the 3D object and one from the cover glass/plastic. We believe specialized filter coatings are required to eliminate/minimize this. ï‚· VCSEL array manufacturingâ€”Unlike single-point VCSELs, we understand that the light source for this sensor package is a 10x10 array of 100 individual VCSELs and is possibly larger. This is a first as we understand it and materially increases the yield difficulty for manufacturing, in our opinion. We believe this makes the playing field relatively level for LITE vs. IIVI, though we believe IIVIâ€™s in-house EPI makes its spin-up even more challenging. ï‚· Processingâ€”Processing the data off of the sensor is a challenging computational task, in which we believe Primesense/Apple has a material IP advantage. Looking forward, this could manifest itself as a key competitive advantage for Apple. 3 157"

The return to growth occurred a quarter earlier than ahead of iPhone 6 (returned to growth June 2014, +18% Y/Y). Off balance sheet commitments are 96% correlated to next quarter revenue (Exhibit 3), implying March quarter sales north of $60B compared to guidance of $51.5-53.5B. Similarly, vendor non-trade receivables increased 19%, an acceleration from flat in September and decline of -8% in FY16. These receivables have 92% correlation to next quarter revenue (Exhibit 4), and also imply revenue upside. While extrapolations from these metrics are not always precise and there is a bigger seasonal discrepancy in March quarters, directionally they do suggest Apple is planning for strong demand and/or making purchase commitments to lock in favorable pricing, especially in memory.

While the pace of recovery could slow in June as Apple prepares for its biggest iPhone launch in three years, we expect the market to look through any weakness as was the case ahead of iPhone 6. We're increasingly convinced Street estimates are too low for FY18. iPhone returned to growth despite no major form factor change and currency headwinds during the December quarter. iPhone engagement and loyalty rates remain high, supported by 21% Services revenue growth (backing out $548M litigation benefit a year ago). New OLED displays, improved battery technology, and a redesigned form factor at the high-end of the portfolio are likely to accelerate upgrade rates in FY18. China will lead growth, in our view, and could account for all incremental iPhone shipments embedded in consensus models           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a next year, even if the upgrade rate doesn't accelerate from current lows (Exhibit   result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a 2).

M&A is difficult to handicap but as Ben Swinburne highlighted in his DIS upgrade this week (Walt Disney Co: Out of the Woods and Into the Game - Upgrading to OW), a large media deal could be accretive to Apple, which could push our bull case even higher. Raising estimates to reflect Services upside, PT moves to $150. We now model high teens Services revenue growth over the next several years, reflecting management's goal to double revenue over four years. This implies Services revenue could become 19% of revenue and 29% of gross profits assuming low- single digit growth for the rest of the business by 2020. A more meaningful Services contribution suggests a 14-15x P/E could be sustainable long-term rather than reached only around large product cycles. Our FY17e Revenue and EPS both increase 2% to $221B and $8.61, respectively. FY18e also increases on higher Services growth to $257B revenue (from $255B) and $10.70 EPS (from $10.56). 14x our FY18e EPS drives our $150 PT (up from $148). Our $190 bull case assumes a 15x P/E, better reflecting platform peers, on EPS of $12.70 which incorporates high-end of supercycle growth and partial benefit from other catalysts like higher share repurchases or lower tax rate.

See Exhibit 2 for a summary of estimate changes. Our new December and March quarter estimates are now in line with supply and demand checks. We model 75M iPhones in December and 51M in March, down from 79M and 55M. Our AlphaWise Tracker, which compiles sell-through data using web search analysis, indicates 73.5M iPhone demand in December, after adjusting for Apple's 14-week quarter (Exhibit 3). We expect seasonal channel inventory restocking in both quarters, and expect reported iPhone units to be ahead of sell-through. Our Asia tech team led by Jasmine Lu expects 72M and 47M iPhone builds in both quarters. They recently lowered December builds by 1M due to iPhone 7, and shifted 1M of the March build, which was unchanged, from 7 to 7 Plus. See Monthly Databook: Mixed Start to the Year for more details. We also believe Apple's reported iPhone shipments will be slightly higher than      Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

We increase FY18 iPhone ASP by 6% 2911 flowing through the better mix and new high-end price points. We expect compelling new features such as AMOLED displays, new casing and wireless charging, and think Apple could implement select features only in higher end models and likely raise prices at the high-end, similar to the dual-camera exclusivity and the $20 price increase for the 7 Plus this year. While we think Apple has many levers to offset bill of material increases, we lower FY18 GM by 30bps to 37.7% to consider risk of lower manufacturing yields on new components and recent increases in NAND spot prices and the stronger US Dollar (Exhibit 1). With iPhone gross margin down 560bps from the iPhone 6 cycle, we view our model as baking in growing headwinds like currency. Over the long-run, we see Apple managing to flat gross margin trend with higher margin services growing faster than the overall business and offsetting structural declines in hardware gross margins. We expect Apple's December quarter results to be in line with guidance. We also slightly lowered iPad shipments from 11M to 10M based on supply chain builds. We now model revenue of $76.6B and GM of 38.5%, resulting in EPS of $3.20. Apple guided for revenue of $76-78B and GM of 38.0-38.5%. Consensus is slightly higher at $77.4B and 38.5%. In the last four quarters, Apple's revenue has been within 2% of the mid-point of guidance, and the company has not missed the low-end of the range since they started guiding this way 13 quarters ago. Apple has met or slightly exceeded the high end of its gross margin guidance range over the same time. March quarter guidance likely below consensus estimates, in-line with current market view. We lowered iPad units and increased ASPs to reflect the latest builds and a mix shift towards premium iPads in March and beyond. In the quarter, we model revenue of $51.5B and GM of 38.3%, resulting in EPS of $1.97. While consensus March EPS has been moving lower in the last month, we are still below consensus of $54.3B, 38.8% and $2.11. We believe buy-side expectations are closer to our new forecast than current consensus. In the last 13 quarters, the mid-point of revenue and gross margin guidance has been in line or lower than consensus every time, with revenue lower by 2% on average and GM guidance lower by 31bps on average. Apple is a top pick in US IT Hardware in 2017. We believe the market is focusing too much on near-term data points, and not enough on upcoming catalysts. We see an iPhone supercycle led by China in FY18, and in this report we increased our iPhone ASPs while maintaining shipment estimates for next year. We see a reasonable probability of US cash repatriation during the new administration, which could drive significant cash return and acquisitions, especially in media. US tax reform could lower Apple's tax rate (border adjustments would make it neutral in our rough estimate). We see 24% upside to our price target of $148 (unchanged) on FY18 EPS of $10.56 (previously $10.60), and 60% upside to our bull case, which assumes stronger iPhone and Services growth and some benefit from cash repatriation (share repurchases) and tax reform.

In fact, our analysis of China upgraders suggests that even a flat China upgrade rate next cycle will result in at least 20% iPhone unit growth, compared to current consensus of 10%. We expect supply chain data points and repatriation discussions to positively impact valuation beginning in late C1Q. At 11x our FY18 (supercycle) base case EPS, Apple trades at a discount to the 14.5x P/E multiple when iPhone 6 launched. We view a return to double digit iPhone unit growth, larger base of high margin, recurring services revenue, and increased access to international cash as multiple enhancers. Net, our $148 PT assumes a 14x multiple on base case FY18 EPS of $10.60. Higher iPhone unit growth (20%+ vs. our 12% base case) adds at least $0.50 EPS, $128B of incremental share repurchases over three years post cash repatriation adds another $0.60 EPS, and lower tax rate could        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with add $1-1.50 EPS before the impact of border adjustments.

Additionally, increased tension between president-elect Trump and China or tariffs/border adjustments that disadvantage companies with offshore supply chains is another headline and/or fundamental risk that could weigh on shares near-term. Strengthening USD is hedged over the next few quarters but limits Apple's ability to raise prices to digest increased bill-of-material costs longer- term. Finally, recent strong execution on warranty costs and reduced depreciation set a high bar for margins into the supercycle. However, strong 7 Plus demand despite no form factor change and a $20 price increase suggests there is room for Apple to increase prices for AMOLED iPhones next year. This, along with suppliers sharing the benefit of weaker currencies and increasing services mix limits gross margin risk, in our view. We model total company gross margin flat FY16 to FY18 but iPhone gross margin down 110 bps during that period. 3162"

Off-balance sheet commitments and capital expenditures through September suggest Apple expected weaker iPhone 7 demand. These commitments - to acquire components, manufacturing equipment, and related R&D - fell 4% Y/Y to $35.2B at the end of September (F4Q16), and the 29% Q/Q increase was the lowest since FY12 (Exhibit 2).This is consistent with news over the summer pointing to a slight decline in iPhone 7 production compared to iPhone 6S the year earlier. Similarly, Apple originally planned for $15B of capex in FY16 (does not match cash flow statement exactly), but ended up lowering spend to $12.8B instead (Exhibit 3). While some of the reduction is attributed to improved utilization of product tooling equipment and lower production to address iPhone 6S channel inventory, we also see this as a sign Apple approached iPhone 7           Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Apple's FY17 capex       Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making outlook of $16B, up 25% Y/Y, is supportive of our Supercycle view given the          their investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, majority of capex is attributed to manufacturing equipment in our estimate.          refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this report. Apple's higher FY17 capex plans likely also reflect further data center 3901 investments, similar to its competitors. While product tooling and manufacturing process equipment is the largest driver of capex, data center is the second largest and another contributor to 25% Y/Y capex growth guidance in FY17. Apple expects Services to become a Fortune 100 business in FY17, implying at least 16% revenue growth on top of 22% growth in FY16. In addition, reports suggest Apple is developing proprietary software, and plans to move some workloads in-house. Similarly, Google noted on its last earnings call that it plans to maintain its current levels of capex investment, Facebook is increasing capex investments this year and will come in at the high end of its initial guidance range, and Amazon noted last quarter AWS is an area of spending ramp and that a number of new AWS regions will come online in a few months (all covered by Brian Nowak). Microsoft (covered by Keith Weiss) said its capex growth rate will slow in FY16 due to efficiency improvements but demand continues to grow. While we expect more specific CY17 guidance early next year, these data points support continued cloud capex investments. 3912"

Our math suggests December guidance implies flat to -3% Apple revenue Y/Y, and flat to +4% iPhone shipments Y/Y, better than investors expected heading into the iPhone 7 launch though below more recent buy-side sentiment (Exhibit 2). Additionally, Apple guided iPhone ASPs flat Y/Y, indicating strong Plus mix this cycle. Finally, despite some concerns that gross margin could surprise negatively, the 50bps higher guide compared to September is very consistent with historical seasonality. Net, we see guidance as supporting a view of improving revenue trajectory and stable gross margins, which makes the stock even easier to own ahead of the supercycle next year. Services growth accelerated again, and we think Apple has an appetite for content acquisitions that could boost or even transform this business. Excluding     Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with the one-time Samsung payment, Services Y/Y revenue growth accelerated over           companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

The company is already making small investments in original videos with several musicians, potentially to learn about the market in our view. CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call Apple is ""definitely open"" and will ""definitely look"" at ""acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value"" that may be larger than Apple's past deals. Near-term estimates don't move materially due to OpEx. All else equal, revenue and gross margin guide would move our F1Q17 (Dec) EPS higher, however an extra week of OpEx leaves EPS largely unchanged (up 3 cents to $3.22). While we see modest upside to FY17 if iPhone 7 Plus mix remains strong, we didn't materially change estimates but for a higher tax rate that cuts our estimate by $0.05 to $8.78. As near-term fundamentals stabilize we see shares beginning to trade on FY18 supercycle EPS of $10.60. At a similar multiple to the iPhone 6 cycle (Exhibit 1), or 14x, our PT increases to $148 (from $124, previously). 4342"

But     e = Morgan Stanley Research estimates, a = Actual Company reported data Apple's revenue recognition is limited by its supply, and we still see constraints for certain models today. As a result, we raise iPhone shipment estimates in Sep and Dec Qs. But we kept Mar and Jun Q iPhone revenue roughly unchanged to remain conservative on late cycle demand and mix, especially as some consumers may start to anticipate a new iPhone with even better display and battery life. Strong iPhone demand but limited supply suggests Sep Q results near the high- end of guidance. We increase our iPhone shipments from 43M to 44M and ASP from -7% Y/Y to -3% due to better demand and mix. Our new estimate is in-line with our Asia Technology team's estimate of 44M builds, and our AlphaWise Tracker's estimate of 44M end demand (Exhibit 1). But, we decreased our iPad shipments from 9M to 8M, as Apple did not refresh the lineup before the holiday season, and builds were revised lower. Overall, our Sep Q estimates increased        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a slightly to revenue of $47.2B, GM of 38.0% and EPS of $1.65, which are also in-      result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a line with consensus. These results would be close to the high-end of Apple's         conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider guidance for revenue of $45.5-47.5B and GM of 37.5-38.0%.                            Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their investment decision. Higher Dec Q revenue estimate but remain conservative on GM due to 7 and 7           For analyst certification and other important disclosures, Plus component cost increases. We increased iPhone shipments from 72M to             refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this report. 74M and ASP from -5% Y/Y to +2%. The higher-priced Plus is more popular than 5181 before, and so is Jet Black, which is only available in the two higher memory capacity configurations. Some suppliers remain conservative on component bottlenecks for the Plus leading to our Asia Tech team's 73M build estimate for the quarter, up from 72M previously. iPhone upside is slightly offset by iPads, where we lowered shipments from 15M to 11M. In total, we estimate revenue of $74.8B, close to a year ago, but GM of 38.5%, 160bps lower Y/Y due to the more costly 7 Plus, resulting in EPS of $3.19. Our estimates are close to consensus, except GM where we are 50bps lower. We expect guidance close to or modestly above $75B at the mid-point, while GM guidance could be lower than consensus of 39%, which was the case in each of the last four quarters. Near-term outperformance helps but the real catalyst is the FY18 supercycle. AAPL shares have priced in positive estimate revisions for the 7 cycle, which is warranted given the slew of positive demand and supply chain data points. Our Asia Tech team recently raised Dec Q iPhone builds by 1M, while other data points suggest even larger revisions. For example, Dialog's (covered by Francois Meunier) Sep Q upside translates into 11M or more iPhones. Importantly, we do not believe shares price in the FY18 supercycle. With an iPhone installed base that is 60% larger but unit estimates just 6% higher as compared to iPhone 6, we see potential for meaningfully positive FY18 estimate revisions. We believe accelerating iPhone growth could drive AAPL towards our bull case of $162 based on FY18 EPS of $11 and a 15x multiple, which is more in-line with where the stock peaked during the iPhone 6 supercycle. 5192"

Customers can get a free 32GB iPhone 7 ($650 value) by trading in an eligible device in good working condition and signing up for a 24-month service agreement. These promotions are more aggressive than last yearâ€™s deals for the iPhone 6s, which largely only subsidized part of the handset value with an eligible trade in at certain carriers. We believe iPhone users may be more willing to upgrade to the iPhone 7 due to the more aggressive promotions, despite the 2-year lock in. Other data points since Apple's iPhone keynote have been generally positive. Most reviews today have a positive tone, noting the better cameras, longer battery life, water resistance, and some even said the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack is not a major issue. Our Asia tech team, led by Jasmine Lu, maintained total iPhone build estimates of 44M in Sep Q and 72M in Dec Q, unchanged from last Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with month. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus builds of 83M in C2H16 are also unchanged and              companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Each               refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this report. incremental 1M iPhones would boost C2H16 Y/Y unit growth by one point. 5861 Only a small portion of Apple's growing iPhone installed base needs to upgrade to reach our FY17 estimates. We think Apple has over 600M iPhone users today. We conservatively assume 30% of iPhones are sold to new users - Apple has been tracking ahead of that in recent quarters - which accounts for 66M of the 219M iPhones we model for FY17. So only 25% of the current installed base needs to refresh for Apple to sell the remaining 153M iPhones. We think that is quite reasonable, as it implies a four-year iPhone life, and our global consumer survey in June revealed that about half of iPhone users still have 4"" versions (5, 5s, 5c, SE). While some will upgrade to the SE, many will pick a larger iPhone in our view. A stronger iPhone 7 cycle would build investor confidence and expand the multiple heading into the FY18 supercycle. We see several tailwinds that present an attractive risk-reward near-term. Investor expectations were low coming into the iPhone 7 cycle, with many questioning whether negative iPhone growth was possible in FY17. Yet, we see stronger US carrier pre-orders as evidence iPhone 6 users are beginning to upgrade, Samsung Note recall may be driving share to Apple at the high-end, and more aggressive carrier promotions can help offset purchasing delays ahead of an OLED-based iPhone next year. Importantly, we see an iPhone supercycle next year driven by a 60% larger user base compared to when iPhone 6 launched, a new full-screen, slimmer form factor, and meaningfully longer battery life and wireless charging as key drivers. As evidence of a more meaningful product cycle unfolds over the next 2-3 quarters, we see Street estimates moving higher. We maintain our $123 price target, which is 14x FY17e EPS of $8.80 or 12x FY18e EPS of $10.20. Our $163 bull case is 15x FY18e EPS of $11, more in-line with where the stock peaked during the iPhone 6 supercycle. 5872"

However, we believe many users will have to purchase new headphones or additional adapters. Additionally, Apple will ship wireless AirPods in late October at a $159 price point which could add a new revenue stream. Based on accessories revenue growth in 2012 when iPhone 5 first adopted the Lightning port, we think Apple can generate $1-2B of incremental accessories revenue in the next 12 months, and boost gross margins by 10-20bps. Services growth and iPhone 7 Plus price increase should help protect Apple's gross margins. The company announced 17M paid subscribers for Music, up from 15M in June, and continues to net add about 1M subscribers per month since launch. Management noted 106% Y/Y growth in app downloads in the last two months, likely helped by Pokemon GO. Nevertheless, this still implies an impressive acceleration from 37% App Store revenue growth in the June quarter.       Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a Download growth was higher than revenue growth but still double-digits in our        result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a estimation.

New Watch Series 2 is a more formidable competitor to Garmin and Fitbit. Apple announced a new swim-proof Watch with built-in GPS and faster processors, and partnered with Nike for a set of exclusive bands and watch faces. Apple also updated Watch Series 1 with new processors and lowered the price by $30 to $269. We believe GPS will be a very popular feature, and Series 2 will be more competitive for Garmin's Fitness segment, in particular the Vivo line and lower-end of the Forerunner line. We continue to believe GRMN is pricing in very optimistic Outdoor and Fitness revenue growth in 2017. Watch Series 2 will also compete with Fitbit but mainly the higher-end Blaze and Surge. The latter accounts for a small portion of Fitbit's revenues and should receive a boost from its own refresh next year. Time to shift focus to the upcoming iPhone supercycle. With the iPhone 7 launch as expected and behind us, and iPhone builds steady for C2H16 in our latest checks, we think investors will start shifting focus to the next iPhone launch in 12 months. We expect OLED displays and much longer battery life and/or new wireless charging capabilities â€“ technology previewed in the new AirPods Apple announced today. We model iPhone unit growth improving from -5% in FY16 to +5% and +12% in the next two iPhone cycles. Our $123 price target assumes 14x FY17e EPS of $8.80 (11x excluding net cash), in-line with where AAPL traded ahead of the last iPhone 6 supercycle. 5982"

We see Apple earning $10.20 in EPS in FY18, ahead of current consensus of $9.54. Results and guidance push margin debate to the back burner. June quarter gross margin came in at the high end of the guidance range (37.5-38.0%) despite higher than expected channel inventory reductions ($3.6B vs. $2B) as COGS were better than expected due to component cost declines and better product quality (lower warranty accruals). While we fully expect investors to question the impact of a higher iPhone 7 bill of materials like in past cycles, the gross margin bear case is less compelling as Apple just gave stable gross margin guidance despite NAND prices rising, SE mix increasing, and the toughest foreign currency compare (large hedge gains a year ago). Some may attribute the better than expected September quarter guidance to a potentially earlier ship-date for iPhone 7 than last year, but if that is the case, guidance already bakes in the margin implications of the higher iPhone 7 bill of materials.

This is consistent with the better June iPhone sell-out and September        refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this guidance. Our analysis suggests iPhone estimates remain very conservative. We          report. model 219M shipments in FY17 (iPhone 7 cycle), which implies a three-year iPhone 57 1 life with 153M refreshers from FY14 at 90% loyalty (169M x 90%), and the rest attributed to new users. This means new users only account for 30% of FY17 iPhones, which is a lower mix than our estimate for iPhone 6 despite management noting an all-time high switching rate. Higher Services growth sustainable over time with several key drivers. Eight years after its launch, App Store growth is actually accelerating. We attribute this growth to the increasing installed base, and new devices (Watch and Apple TV). Pokemon GO should also provide a boost in the September quarter. Apple Music subscriptions is now large enough to offset iTunes declines, and the category as a whole is growing. iCloud subscriptions (for more storage) continue to grow and is now large enough to matter. AppleCare also benefits from the larger installed base. The 100th company on Fortune's list, Northwestern Mutual, generated $28B of revenue. We now expect Apple to generate 22% and 14% Services growth in FY16 and FY17 to get to that level, a target management highlighted on the earnings call. Raising price target to $123 from $120 on higher FY17 EPS. We assume 5% iPhone unit growth in FY17 to 219M, 4% ASP decline to $621, and roughly flat Y/Y GM of 39.0%. Our iPhone 7 expectations are unchanged though we shift several million iPhones from FY17 to FY16 to account for an earlier launch this September. We also increased our iPad ASP estimate from $429 to $469 in FY17 due to Pro mix. And we doubled Services growth from 7% to 14% in FY17. Our target valuation remains unchanged at 14x P/E (11x excluding net cash), which is in line with where shares traded ahead of the iPhone 6 supercycle. 58 2"

Management commented that the number of switchers from Android continues to be strong and that iPhone SE demand outpaced supply during the quarter. We believe that better sell-through reads across slightly positively to the broader macro spending situation though we note that overall market number and Appleâ€™s own numbers remain weak with iPhone revenue down 23% Y/Y. Android switchers Tim Cook said that the company has added â€œmillions of first-time smartphone buyersâ€ in the June quarter and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales the company ever measured. We believe that strong adoption of smaller screen iPhones is likely helping the percentages here. Heading into CQ2, our estimate of the switching rate was <0.5% and we believe that the company ended up with a roughly ~1% Android switching rate. In absolute terms, Apple said that YTD iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest the company has ever seen in any nine-month period and that its active user base grew double digits Y/Y. We estimate that the iPhone installed base grew by ~28% Y/Y. to ~900m+ users. iPad bounces back iPad shipments in FQ3 at 10m units were 11% above our estimate and iPad ASP at $490 was 18% above our estimate, we believe due to strong sales of the iPad Pro. We believe that the iPad ASP may come off of the strong FQ3 levels as the mix of iPad Pros gives way in the back to school season to less expensive models. Solid margins despite iPhone ASP drop and inventory reduction Non-GAAP Gross Margin in FQ3 was 38.5% or 0.3pp above our estimate and GAAP Gross Margin at 38% was at the high end of the companyâ€™s guidance range (37.5%-38%). We note the strong margin performance in light of weaker than expected iPhone ASP during the quarter and believe it highlights strong execution on supply chain cost control by Apple as well as the ability of the brand to retain value even in the midst of weaker demand. Guidance beat The mid-point of Appleâ€™s FQ4 revenue guidance at $46.5bn (range: $45.5bn- $47.5bn) was 2% above consensus and ~4% above our estimate. We believe that continued strength in the iPhone SE combined with better than expected end market demand is driving better revenue guidance for FQ4. iPhone SE shipments solid Apple noted on the call that iPhone SE demand outstripped supply in both emerging and developed markets over the quarter. We estimate that there were ~10m SE units shipped, assuming an ASP of $450. Note that we are also implicitly assuming minimal price discounting of iPhones that were cleared from inventory during the quarter. 3 72"

We expect Apple Music and Pay to continue to drive high Services growth, and estimate 18% Y/Y for the June quarter. Apple could guide gross margin slightly lower than consensus for the September quarter. Consensus models C3Q16 revenue of $46.0B, gross margin of 38.5%, and EPS of $1.61. While we are not far off at $45.6B, 38.2% and $1.60, the big difference is gross margin, the key metric this quarter. Similarly in the last two quarters, consensus gross margin estimates heading into earnings were 50bps and 100bps higher than the high-end of Apple's guidance range. We believe new iPhones in September could have slightly lower gross margins initially as the product ramps offsetting the benefit of improved mix compared to the SE launch and high-end iPhone inventory reduction in the June quarter. iPhone growth rates should start improving in the September quarter after a              Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

A new Watch could provide an extra boost 1481 but is more likely to benefit the December quarter. We expect an evolutionary refresh though some media reports suggest it could be more significant with features such as GPS or cellular. Investors will increasingly look forward to the 2017 iPhone cycle. We see several potentially revolutionary features, especially in display and battery life, that Apple could launch in just over a year from now. Similar to the first large screen iPhone, the 6 in 2014, investors anticipate a meaningful product launch at least a year ahead of time. As iPhone growth troughs in the June quarter and as gross margin expectations are reset this earnings season, we think Apple sentiment should improve going forward. Our price target of $120 is based on 14x FY17 EPS of $8.55 or 11x excluding net cash. 1492"

Apple has not missed its gross margin guidance range to the downside in any of the last 11 quarters, or since management initiated current guidance methodology. Investors are especially concerned this quarter given the better than expected demand for iPhone SE. Certain models still have a several day to a week long wait on Apple.com. We believe this is consistent with management commentary that they will not reach supply/demand balance in the June quarter. Our analysis indicates iPhone SE has about 40% gross margin (Exhibit 2). While it is lower than other iPhones, it is still higher than guidance for 37.5-38.0% gross margin which combined with constraints capping SE mix limits margin dilution this quarter. Other gross margin drivers are skewed positively near term. The US                 Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with Dollar is roughly unchanged compared to when Apple gave guidance on April          companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Our Semi analyst Joe Moore estimates memory pricing (NAND and            refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this DRAM) declined 10% Q/Q in the March quarter, which is relevant to Apple's          report. 1851 Apple, Inc. June quarter as it buys ahead. So we expect Apple's contract pricing to be lower Q/Q as well. Conservations with suppliers suggest Apple is achieving better cost deflation this cycle. However, we lower September quarter gross margin as SE mix rises. Historically, new iPhone form factors have put more pressure on September margins: notably in September 2012 gross margin fell 2.8 points Q/Q with iPhone 5 and in September 2014 it fell 1.4 points with iPhone 6. In September 2013 and 2015 with 5s and 6s, gross margin actually improved 0.1 and 0.2 points Q/Q. We believe the upcoming iPhone 7 has fewer new features and a smaller form factor change compared to other ""numbered"" cycles, making it more like an ""S"" cycle. However, improving SE supply to meet demand in the September quarter increases low-end mix, likely leaving gross margin flat with June at 38% (Exhibit 3), which is now reflected in our estimates (down from 38.8% and consensus of 38.6%). This lowers our FY16 EPS to $8.20 (from $8.25) and flowing through modestly lower iPhone margins takes our FY17 to $8.55, from $8.78 previously. Our $120 PT is unchanged but we now apply a 14x multiple to FY17 EPS, in line with where shares traded ahead of the iPhone 6 supercycle (Exhibit 5). We expect new battery performance and form factor improvements to launch in September 2017 which will drive a return to iPhone unit growth and multiple expansion in anticipation of the launch. 1862 Apple, Inc.

Apple is lowering channel inventory by $2B or $1.2B more than a year ago. Revenue guidance would have been seasonal without the $1.2B additional destocking.

Given the mixed macroeconomic commentary and the slower upgrade cycle highlighted by both Apple and US carriers, we assume little improvement in the next two quarters. We model 42M iPhones in the September quarter, and 75M iPhones in the December quarter (flat with the last two iPhone cycles). We lower CY16 GM to 38.9%, from 39.5% previously, to account for lower iPhone and higher iPad mix. Net, our CY16 EPS of $8 feels de-risked for currency, end demand and inventory fluctuations as we see them today. Longer-term, we expect iPhone demand to improve. The installed base exiting the March quarter is 80% larger than two years ago, and India should become a bigger growth driver as LTE infrastructure and Apple's distribution are built out in the country. While shares may take a pause near-term, we like the set-up of a lower bar heading into easier compares and product cycles in C2H16. 4062"

OW The main point we are making in this preview is that we do not see any evidence that                    Telecom & Networking iPhone orders for the June quarter have been reduced as was reported by Nikkei last                     Equipment/IT Hardware Friday. We believe that June QTR iPhone build plans have remained stable since                          Rod Hall, CFA AC March at around 43-45m units. While the Japan earthquake on April 20 could have                         (1-415) 315-6713 some impact on forward production, we do not believe this is a material issue for the                   rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com FQ2 or FQ3 (to June). We believe market forecasts have crept up too much and see                        Bloomberg JPMA HALL <GO> our own 47m unit forecast as more likely. Our main area of interest in the quarter is                   J.P.

AAPL, AAPL US Price: $106.91 Tax scenarios update: Impacts remain small and Price Target: $141.00 possibly positive in the case of US reform. Reit. OW. Recent Treasury rule changes generated a lot of incoming calls for us given the                         Telecom & Networking detailed tax work we have published on Apple (link). One of the most common                             Equipment/IT Hardware questions is just what the real underlying tax rate is that Apple is paying on its US                   Rod Hall, CFA AC earnings and how to simply understand this. We conclude that Apple currently                            (1-415) 315-6713 pays 31% on US EBT (34% of total EBT), reports but pays nothing on 36% of                               rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com EBT and then doesnâ€™t report 30% of EBT for tax purposes. In terms of EPS                                Bloomberg JPMA HALL <GO> impact from tax changes we present two main updated scenarios resulting in                              J.P. Morgan Securities LLC +2.0%-(2.5)% of total impact. Interestingly, we believe US tax reform could                             Ashwin Kesireddy easily result in a positive EPS impact.                                                                 (1-415) 315-6756 ashwin.x.kesireddy@jpmorgan.com ï‚· P&L Tax rate: To calculate the apparent P&L tax rate Apple is paying we first                         J.P. Morgan Securities LLC need to determine EBT on which P&L tax is calculated. From a GAAP P&L                                 Rajagopal RK Raghunathan point of view, we believe that Apple reports tax on ~54% of its foreign                               (1-415) 315-6760 earnings. Given this we estimate that taxable P&L EBT in FY15 was ~$50.8bn,                           rajagopal.raghunathan@jpmorgan.com instead of the reported $72.6bn. Using this and adjusted P&L tax of $17.9bn we                        J.P. Morgan Securities LLC arrive at a 34.9% adjusted rate represented on the P&L vs. the 26.3% investors                        Bala R Reddy will arrive at via direct division of $19.12bn in taxes by $72.6bn reported EBT.                      (91-22) 6157-3373 bala.reddy@jpmorgan.com ï‚· Cash Tax rate: To complicate matters slightly more Apple defers a large chunk                         J.P. Morgan India Private Limited of the tax it reports on the P&L on the portion of foreign earnings that is Price Performance taxable. This is because they treat the earnings as permanently held offshore. For FY15 this deferral resulted in cash tax paid of $13.25bn which results in an                           130 implied cash tax rate of 26.1%. We note that, unlike what some commentators                                120 $ have suggested, we do not believe a likely scenario is a simplistic reversion of                           110 100 cash tax toward the P&L rate. 90 ï‚· Treasury changes not an immediate issue: The new Treasury rules are not, in                                      Apr-15     Jul-15   Oct-15   Jan-16    Apr-16 AAPL share price ($) our opinion, applicable to Apple given the company is not â€œinvertedâ€ but rather                                              S&P500 (rebased) remains based in the US from a tax point of view.

The first assumes that the US disallows Apple's Irish structure somehow as part of an overarching reform of US corporate tax. In this case, we calculate a 2% positive impact to AAPL EPS assuming a 20% effective tax (breakeven at ~22% US tax rate). In our second scenario we assume the EU disallows Apple's special tax deal with Ireland and that this results in payment of full Irish statutory tax. In this case EPS would be negatively impacted by 2.5%. Apple Inc.

The fact that Apple does not use 46% of its offshore (ASI) earnings for tax reporting purposes is what we believe throws most people off in attempts to calculate the effective underlying tax rate. For illustration â€“ Appleâ€™s reported EBT in FY15 was $72.6bn, including ~$47.6bn of foreign earnings. We believe that due to FASBâ€™s accounting requirements, Apple accounted for US tax on just 54% of these foreign earnings and then deferred the tax given the intent to leave the earnings offshore. Subtracting the EBT not reported for tax calculation leaves us with ~$50.8bn of taxable EBT from a GAAP accounting standpoint. On the tax paid/accounted for side of the equation Appleâ€™s reported tax of $19.1bn in FY15 includes ~$1.4bn of deferred taxes. Adjusting for this we calculate reported tax paid of ~$17.7bn â€“ an effective P&L tax rate of 34.9% on EBT of ~$50.8bn. Table 1: Apple: P&L Tax Breakdown $ million, year-end September FY13     FY14     FY15 EBT Summary for Tax EBT on which US Taxes are Paid Total Apple EBT                                     $50.16   $53.48   $72.62 - 46% of ASI (Ireland) EBT left offshore            $14.00   $15.30   $21.80 = EBT on which Apple Pays US Tax                    $36.16   $38.18   $50.82 US Taxes Paid Total P&L Tax reported                              $13.12   $13.97   $19.12 - Deferred portion of reported Tax                   $1.14    $2.35    $1.38 = Current P&L Tax Reported                          $11.98   $11.63   $17.74 Effective Tax Rate on Taxable EBT                   33.1%    30.4%    34.9% Total Cash Tax reported                              $9.13   $10.03   $13.25 Effective Tax Rate on Taxable EBT                   25.2%    26.3%    26.1% Source: Company reports and J.P. Morgan estimates. Needless to say that Apple's reported tax is much different from the tax that the company pays in cash taxes to the IRS. We calculate this cash tax rate is just over 26% due to the fact that Apple is deferring tax on the portion of ASI EBT that it is recognizing for P&L tax. As we touch on throughout this note we believe it is unlikely that this cash tax rate somehow magically converges on the P&L tax rate. Rather, we believe a few different scenarios are possible that have the potential to both positively and negatively affect the overall rate being paid. 2 478"

The stock currently trades below its three- year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x, reflecting the company's reduced revenue growth outlook (vs. the past three years). KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to any significant slowdown in iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's large size makes it more vulnerable to regulatory oversight and the attendant legal costs and uncertainty. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases. Andrew Uerkwitz: 212 667-5316 2 7"

The company currently trades below its three-year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x; we believe the multiple is justified for its reduced revenue growth outlook (comparing to the past three years). KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases. Andrew Uerkwitz: 212 667-5316 2 43"

In other words, we don't expect gross margin to drift lower with iPhone ASP. We also expect less cannibalization risk than with the 5c launched in 2013 given the large screen installed base that is unlikely to downgrade. Debate 3: Has smartphone innovation come to an end? We see revolutionary features including foldable OLED, wireless charging technology launching in the next 1-2 years. Barring new wireless charging technology, which we think has <50% probability of making it into iPhone 7, we see most features as iterative with growth driven by upgrades of a larger installed base post share gains in FY15. The new 4"" iPhone will help improve growth as we head into the end of the iPhone 6s cycle, with the potential to expand share in emerging markets, including India and China. Importantly, we only assume             Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 15% of shipments come from new users in FY17, compared to 45% in FY15.               companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

While there are cleaner stories in tech â€“ FB, MSFT in particular â€“ there arenâ€™t cheaper names. Apple's low valuation stands out, especially among platform companies with high customer loyalty, ability to return significant cash ($49B LTM) while also invest in the future (R&D up 24%, capex up 34% in FY16). We think investors are concerned about Apple's macro comments and many are waiting for the next earnings call to see if fundamentals get worse. We still see an attractive risk/reward heading into the iPhone 7 cycle as iPhone shipments return to growth. 83 2 Apple, Inc. | February 3, 2016 MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH Risk Reward World's Most Valuable Technology Platform Enhanced by New Devices and Services $ 200 Investment Thesis 180                                                                                                             $180.00 (+87%)                           Apple has the world's most valuable technology platform with over one billion active devices, and 160 we believe it is best positioned to capture more of 140                                                                                                                                                      its users' time in areas such as health, autos and $135.00 (+40%) 120                                                                                                                                                      home, as these platforms expand in the Internet of 100 $96.35                                                                  Things computing era.

For perspective, Apple reported a total hedge gain of $515M in F1Q16. The        e = Morgan Stanley Research estim ates, a = Actual Com pany reported data gross margin component of the F1Q16 gain was $306M, compared to an average of $542M in FY15. Apple continues to invest for the future. It ended the December quarter with $28.6B of off-balance sheet commitments, growing 12% Y/Y but decelerating from 38% average Y/Y growth in FY15 (Exhibit 5) to reflect the slowdown in unit and revenue growth. These commitments to acquire components and capital assets (including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment), and for advertising and R&D are a good indicator of future revenue with correlation of 95% since 2007. The correlation would imply close to $65B of revenue in the March quarter. While we do not think this is likely the outcome, we believe this is a sign of Apple's confidence in its future products and initiatives to take advantage of favorable commodity              Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with markets. Management also maintained their $15B capital expenditure                    companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, guidance for FY16.

We currently expect Apple to repurchase $8B a quarter for the rest of FY16 to total $31B for the year through the open market or ASRs. We believe Apple looks at its fully- taxed FCF as a measure of its buyback capacity. Assuming low $50B fully-taxed FCF over the next year, we believe Apple can repurchase close to $40B of shares while increasing the dividend slightly to $12B. Apple repurchased $35B in FY15 and $45B in FY14. Note that Apple has historically returned cash at a faster pace than what is implied by the capital return program, which we expect to be updated the day of March quarter earnings. No change in macroeconomic and currency-related risk factors. Despite management spending more than the usual amount of time on macro headwinds during the recent earnings call, there were no new disclosures in the latest 10-Q. We looked back at Apple's filings in 2009 and 2013 when the stock had ~50% corrections, and found no additional risk factors compared to the current 10-Q. The exception was a disclosure in 2009 that noted Apple had only one wireless provider in some countries, which is no longer the case. We also compared 2013 filings to earlier ones, and found a few interesting new disclosures: (1) gross margins will be lower in FY13, (2) Apple makes prepayments to or invests in certain suppliers and if these suppliers experience financial problems Apple's investment may be devalued, and (3) litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to operations and distracting to management. New disclosures in 2009 filings compared to previous ones include: (1) the financial crisis could impact Apple's business and stock price, (2) margins may decrease from FY08 levels, (3) Steve Jobs was taking a medical leave of absence, (4) Apple may raise prices to offset foreign currency headwinds, and (5) a few disclosures about the iPhone and the App Store, which was relatively new at the time. 1222"

AAPL disclosed that its active installed base (iOS+Mac OS+Watch OS+TV OS) is 1 billion units, which grew 25% Y/Y. We estimate that over half of the installed base are iPhones. â–    Bottom Line: Our AAPL thesis for 2016 is unchanged. For a volatile tech sector in 2016, we believe cash-rich, dividend-paying, and attractively valued stock such as AAPL offer one of the best defensive positions for investors. Reiterate Outperform.

While overall smartphone 120 market growth has slowed in recent years, we continue to see good opportunities for Apple to gain market share in both 100 developed and emerging markets due to its significantly superior 80                                                                     user experience, human-computer interface, and premium 60                                                                     branding.

The company currently trades below its three-year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x; we believe the multiple is justified for its reduced revenue growth outlook (comparing to the past three years). KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases. Andrew Uerkwitz: 212 667-5316 2 133"

We believe iPhone growth can improve after March, as Y/Y comparisons get easier and Apple refreshes the 4"" iPhone. (2) Appleâ€™s Services business is even more attractive than we thought, with better than corporate average margin (we estimate 55% on a reported basis) and 15% revenue growth in F1Q16 accelerating from 10% in FY15 (excluding the $548M one- time payment), driven by the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple Pay. (3) India is a new focus. It is the third largest smartphone market with a young demographic (average age of 27) that tends to skew toward Apple products. Despite growing 48% in F1Q16, Apple's revenue in the country is still very small. China is still the main growth driver, but expect to hear more about India over the next year. 4) Apple hedges its Chinese Yuan exposure. China accounted for 26% of revenue in the LTM and it is growing. With the Yuan depreciating against the USD, investors were concerned about the exposure.

We lower our FY16 EPS to $9 from $9.50. We lower FY16 revenue to $226.5B (-3% Y/Y) from $238.8B (+2%). We slightly lower iPhone units to 215.8M (-7% Y/Y) from 218.0M (-6%), and iPad units to 43.6M (-20%) from 44.5M (-19%). We also lower ASPs partially to take into account the stronger foreign currency headwinds. However, gross margin remains the same as hedging and component cost declines offset currency risk. Operating expenses are slightly lower though, at 12% Y/Y growth, we assume Apple continues to invest in future products and services. Our new price target of $135 assumes the same 15x P/E as our previous target ($143). 1532"

We had actually thought that the ASP could be weaker due to mix shift toward the iPhone6 instead of the 6s.

We believe this number is materially better than the â€˜low-70sâ€™ unit number that we believe many investors had thought was likely. Combined with the better ASP, overall iPhone revenue at $51.6bn was inline with our estimate. Adjusted Gross Margin in FQ1â€™16 was 40.0%, inline with our estimate, and GAAP gross margin at 40.1% was 0.2pp better than consensus. GAAP opex at $6.252m was 3% below consensus.

This implies mid to high-40M iPhone shipments, down mid to high-30% Q/Q. We expect management to guide to relatively stable gross margins, in the 38.5% to 40% range from the past four quarters. Foreign currency has been a Q/Q headwind for the last two years and, based on QTD data, it will be a near 1% Q/Q headwind in the March quarter. We think Apple can offset some of this with component price declines, lower warranty accruals, and/or suppliers sharing currency gains. We believe a mix shift towards iPhone 6 (older version), larger screen sizes and larger memory capacities will largely offset the margin impact from lower iPhone volumes. Investor sentiment is more cautious than the consensus view of $56B of revenue, 40% gross margin and $2.25 EPS with roughly 52M iPhone units. We believe guidance of $50B to $52B in revenue and $1.90 to $2.00 in Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with EPS is a reasonable bogey. This implies about 46M iPhones shipments.

Finally, we see potential for unit upside in the June quarter with the introduction of the rumored 4"" iPhone, especially in emerging markets like India to capture more price conscious users. We don't believe the new SKU is currently reflected in Apple consensus estimates. We see the stock bottoming in the mid-$90s assuming Appleâ€™s guidance is within lowered expectations. Investors now expect FY16 EPS of $8.50 or maybe slightly less. The low end of expectations for March quarter guidance as noted above would imply EPS $1.90, or 22% of $8.50 total FY16 EPS, which is in line with the last three years where March quarter has accounted for 22-25% of full year EPS. In addition, our Asia tech teamâ€™s preliminary estimate for iPhone builds in the June quarter is 40M, flat Q/Q vs. down mid to high-teens Q/Q in the last three June quarters, and points to improving seasonality after inventory adjustments in March. 2232"

Looking at typical volumes of old generation iPhones in past cycles, 4â€ iPhone volumes could run in the 15M range. We donâ€™t believe the new SKU is included in March quarter production plans or in consensus Apple estimates. Assuming corporate average gross and operating margins, the new 4"" iPhone could add $0.25-0.30 of annual EPS, which more than offsets the potential for another 5M iPhone unit reduction (at higher ASP/margin) in-line with recent supply chain revisions. Net, we leave our FY16 iPhone unit and EPS estimates unchanged. Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

The company currently trades slightly below its three-year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x; we believe the multiple is justified for its reduced revenue growth outlook (comparing to the past three years). KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases. Andrew Uerkwitz: 212 667-5316 2 256"

We see a return to growth in September 2016 as the large base of new users added during the iPhone 6 cycle begin to upgrade. We also see potential upside to our forecast if Apple decides to launch the rumored new 4â€ iPhone which suppliers expect to begin building in the March time frame (see Potential Launch of 4"" iPhone Model published December 1, 2015). A smaller device is likely to capture more price conscious users, particularly in emerging markets like India. Positive mix shift partially offsets unit weakness and reflects Appleâ€™s strong competitive position. We see a number of mix factors driving ASP and margin upside: 1) mix shift to larger screens, with the 5.5"" iPhones accounting    Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with for 40% of US purchase intentions in October 2015 vs. 23% in December 2014         companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict (Exhibit 3), 2) mix shift to higher NAND capacities, with 64GB accounting for      of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan 54% of US purchase intentions in October 2015 vs. 18% in December 2014             Stanley Research.

Our gross margin assumption           report. 3091 Apple, Inc. | December 13, 2015 MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH drops modestly (39.7% vs. 40.3%) with decreased iPhone unit scale but we continues see gross margins remaining in a tight range of 39-40%. Why this is different than 2012-13? 1) Apple remains a share gainer, though in a weaker overall growth environment. iPhone gained 2.4 points of unit share LTM versus losing 3.6 points of share in 2013. Our survey data points to record share gains in 2016, specifically eight points in the US and two points in China (Exhibits 5 and 6). 2) Gross margin risk is limited. In 2012 Apple gross margin peaked at 47% followed by a trough of 37% in 2013. We donâ€™t see similar volatility given favorable component costs and positive iPhone mix shifts that will help expand ASPs. 3) Appleâ€™s large cash return policy, with buybacks adding five points of EPS growth in FY16 vs. one point in FY13. Strong cash generation should maintain this earnings tailwind going forward with repatriation a wildcard that could accelerate the pace of buybacks and/or accretive M&A. 4) New markets, like Autos, represent meaningful addressable market expansion. 3102 Apple, Inc. | December 13, 2015 MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH Risk Reward World's Most Valuable Technology Platform Enhanced by New Devices and Services $ 200 Investment Thesis $189.00 (+67%) 180                                                                                                                                                                   Apple has the world's most valuable technology platform, and we believe it is best positioned to 160 capture more of their users' time in areas such as 140                                                                                                                       $143.00 (+26%) health, autos and home, as these platforms expand 120                                                                                   $113.18                                                                         in the Internet of Things computing era.

Note this capital expenditure number differs from the cash number Apple reports in its cash flow statement, but it is a good indication of revenue with 80% correlation. The spend extrapolates to $252B of revenue in FY16, or 3% above consensus. Apple's capital expenditure tends to grow faster during years when iPhones with new form factors launch (numbered cycles), and FY16 is no different as spending growth of 34% accelerates from 2%, or $11.2B in FY15. We understand the increase in FY16 comes from three areas: product tooling and manufacturing process equipment (e.g. production capacity), data center capacity as Apple is increasing the number of Internet services it provides to a growing user base, and construction for the new campus as it is nearing completion in FY16.

Apple should recoup over time some of the up front expenses it incurs for the iPhone Upgrade Program. The company has two additional expenses with this program: a cost for the interest free financing that a third- party bank is providing, and an accounting expense as Apple assumes the expected resell value of the returned iPhone is less than the outstanding loan balance. When a user returns his/her iPhone and gets a new one, Apple has to pay off the loan balance on the returned iPhone and resell it (through a third- party reseller). We actually think the program is better for Apple over time since (1) it does not have to sell iPhones to wireless providers at a discount, (2) Apple's program has 100% AppleCare+ attach rate, and (3) refurbished iPhones are selling at prices where Apple is likely to end up realizing gains instead of expenses. From the filing: ""The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue."" The company is stepping up its advertising. Advertising expense was $1.8B in FY15, up 50% Y/Y and accelerating from 7-10% growth in the prior three years. With large screen iPhones, Apple Watch, MacBook, Pay and Music, Apple had many new products to communicate to users last year. Samsung's advertising spending still dwarfs Apple at $3.3B in CY14 but it was -9% Y/Y, and it is -6% in C1H15. Indirect brand advertising created by Apple-owned retail stores explains the lower direct spend versus Samsung. 3792"

While a small portion of the ASP      e = Morgan Stanley Research estim ates lift in the September quarter was a function of lower deferred revenue, iPhone ASP rose 11% Y/Y and 1% Q/Q, above our 6% forecast. Similarly, iPad and Mac ASPs were better than expected even after adjusting for the lower deferrals. Our data on iPhone mix points to flat ASPs in FY16 compared to our forecast for -3%. The $5 lower deferral on iOS devices and $10 lower on Macs provide an additional ASP boost through FY16. All regions saw strong iPhone demand. Europe revenue grew 18% Y/Y at constant currency (vs. +2% reported) with strong underlying iPhone demand in Germany, Italy, France, Spain and India despite mixed third-party data. All this despite Europe having less distribution for the new iPhone in the quarter compared to last year, the opposite of China. Japan saw 29% constant currency revenue growth and APAC 49%.

We believe currency is partially offset by lower revenue deferrals (costs are always expensed) and better iPhone 6 margins as the product benefits from further component cost declines. While March quarter remains at the center of the bear debate, our work highlighted above, suggests growth will carry into next calendar year. Management remains confident that long-term trends remain favorable. When asked about future iPhone growth prospects, CEO Tim Cook noted the growth of China's middle class and low LTE adoption as key drivers. He also points to smartphone installment and leasing programs from Apple and wireless providers that will shorten iPhone replacement cycles and create a more subscription-like instead of transactional business for Apple. 4072"

The company currently trades slightly below its three-year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x; we believe the multiple is justified for its slightly reduced revenue growth outlook (comparing to the past three years) and our projected annual EPS growth of over 10% per year. KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases. Andrew Uerkwitz: 212 667-5316 2 434"

We expect Apple to guide similar to past quarters, or slightly below consensus implying slight iPhone growth at the mid-point. In the last 10 quarters, the mid-point of Apple's revenue guidance has been 3% lower than consensus though during the 6 cycle it was 1% lower. This implies revenue range of $74B to $76B in the December quarter, or up 50% Q/Q, which is close to 54% in FY13 and 52% in FY12 before the 6 cycle. We expect management to message stable gross margin, similar to recent quarters, with a range of 38.5% to 39.5% most likely. Consensus models $77B of revenue, 39.7% gross margin and $3.21 of EPS with roughly 76M iPhones. We see upside to December quarter revenue driven by iPhone demand. We model 79M iPhones (+6% Y/Y) for the quarter and 248M (+7%) for FY16, based on our recent AlphaWise surveys in the US and China, which indicate Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with purchase intention share gains (Exhibits 2 and 3).

Investors should consider Morgan target, and never got higher than that through the last iPhone cycle.

Net, we model $78.9B of revenue in the quarter, consistent with the level of upside over the past two years. Reported revenue has been 6% higher than the mid-point of guidance in the last 10 quarters, and 9% higher in the 6 cycle. Several factors suggest potential gross margin upside going forward, though we do not expect a significant step up in December quarter guidance, if any. (1) Increasing mix of iPhones and Accessories, including Watch, and lower mix of Macs and iPads. (2) Improving iPhone 6s and 6s Plus and Watch margins as they ramp. (3) We estimate iPhone 6 gross margins should be close to 6s, as component cost declines over the last year offsets the $100 price decrease on the 6. (4) Apple raised prices in certain regions in the last two quarters to offset foreign currency headwinds, and asked suppliers to share their FX gains. While the price increases will impact demand in the Eurozone, Russia, etc., it should help margins, which have been under FX pressure in the last 12 months. (5) Increasing AppleCare (extended warranty) attach rate as iPhone Upgrade Program (100% attach) gains subscribers. Weak sentiment, potential positive revisions, and below industry valuation provides an attractive set-up . Investors are concerned December quarter iPhone shipments could be down Y/Y, and even if not, March quarter is another tough Y/Y comparison. We expect iPhone unit - and possibly ASP and margin - upside to change that view in the next two quarters. Valuation remains low at 11x our CY16 EPS estimate of $10.80 or 8x ex-net cash. Apple's FCF was 25% higher than net income the last two years, and that gap should widen as Apple offers more services. On EV/FCF, Apple is trading at 7x CY16 FCF, lower than large cap Tech Hardware at 10x. 4702"

Price Performance ï‚· CQ4 revised up: Based on supply chain checks from our Asian colleagues (note                            130 here), we believe Apple has revised up CQ4 iPhone build plans by almost 5m units                         120 $ 110 to 75m-80m from 70m-75m probably driven by solid iPhone 6s/6s+ demand. In the 100 case of the 6s+ order lead times have pushed out, suggesting demand may be tilting 90 in that direction more than Apple expected. Barring macro deterioration, we expect                             Oct-14     Jan-15   Apr-15   Jul-15    Oct-15 Apple to reach our estimate of 75m iPhone shipments for CQ4.                                                               AAPL share price ($) S&P500 (rebased) ï‚· CQ1 revised down: Based on the same check, we also believe Apple is proactively                                         YTD        1m            3m            12m Abs             1.8%       -0.9%         -11.7%        11.7% reducing component orders for CQ1 by ~5m units to 45m-50m from 50m-55m. We                              Rel             5.6%       -1.4%         -7.4%         10.9% see the direction here as more important than the absolute level. Given the possibility of weak macro, we believe Apple may be prudently planning for reduced channel inventory in CQ1 as a buffer again possible demand weakness. ï‚· FQ3/FQ4â€™16 estimates unchanged: We reduce our FQ2/CQ1 iPhone unit estimate by 2m to 60m units but leave FQ3 and FQ4 unchanged at 51m and 54m, respectively. Our estimate for FY16 iPhone shipments comes down by 2m or 0.9% to 240m, but continues to imply Y/Y growth of 4%. ï‚· No signs of underlying demand weakness: At this point we do not believe demand has materially weakened for the iPhone but we equally do not believe Apple will be unaffected should global consumer demand continue to weaken.

Apple's closing price of $111.31 on Oct. 6th reflects less than 9x FY16E EPS ex-cash, an unjustified position given the quality of the company and better than ever competitive position. Our $155 price target is based on 12.5x FY16E EPS of $10.47 plus $25 per share cash. â–    Bottom Line: We believe fear over Apple's growth challenge is exaggerated. We see Apple (especially the iPhone) continuing to benefit from two secular trends in consumer electronics: 1) upgrade to premium, life-style focusing products in developing countries, and 2) evolving device ecosystems that favor tight hardware-software integration and superior user experience.

The company currently trades slightly above its three-year median FY2E P/E of 11.5x; we believe AAPL deserves a premium multiple based on its refreshed product cycle, strengthened ecosystem, and upbeat prospects on new products. KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases. Andrew Uerkwitz: 212 667-5316 2 500"

Our FY2019 Apple Car scenario assumes a $55,000 ASP and 200K shipments, yielding an EPS benefit of ~$0.32. When paired with a forward P/E of ~10x this contributes ~$3 to the AAPL stock price. Introducing FY19 Apple Car â€œBlue Skyâ€ Scenario Our 2019 Apple Car scenario (Chart 2) which assumes 200K Apple Car shipments at an ASP of $55,000 and OPM of 20% suggests that 1) Car is capable of moving the EPS needle for Apple, but requires the realization of scale benefits and assumes that Appleâ€™s premium brand would extend to the Car, 2) Apple would find it difficult to reproduce its ~30% Source: Jefferies                                  iPhone-driven OPM profile in Car, and 3) even after a Car is potentially introduced, iPhone would remain a significant if not majority driver of OP and EPS.

We do think the prospect of an Apple Car is interesting and could ultimately make us more constructive on the stock. While the stockâ€™s decline over recent weeks has made it incrementally more attractive to us, we decided not to upgrade our rating because 1) we continue to believe structural iPhone risk is still not fully baked into the stock price, and 2) while mainstream media over the last few months have discussed the possibility of Apple introducing a Car, we donâ€™t think investors are assigning a high probability to such an event, in part due to nervousness around potential transition to a lower-margin business. page 4 of 68                                                                              Sundeep Bajikar, Equity Analyst, (415) 229-1552, sbajikar@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 64 - 68 of this report. 525 AAPL Estimate Change September 23, 2015 We would like to see investor concerns in both areas dissipate to a greater extent before we can aggressively recommend buying AAPL stock.

Upside Risks: Apple could invent a new type of fuel source for Cars with better economics than our forecasts. Smartphone competition (primarily Samsung Electronics, Huawei and Xiaomi) misexecutes, allowing iPhone to continue to outperform for longer than investors expect. Watch shipments accelerate and more than offset iPhone risk. page 5 of 68                                                                                 Sundeep Bajikar, Equity Analyst, (415) 229-1552, sbajikar@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 64 - 68 of this report. 526 AAPL Estimate Change September 23, 2015 Why Apple Car?

Our FY16 Base Case assumes 228.5m iPhones, 25m Apple Watches, and services revenues of $23.6B. Our FY16 Base Case EPS estimate of $9.71 remains unchanged, and is roughly in line with Street estimates. Our FY16 Bull Case assumes 247m iPhones, 32.5m Apple Watches, and services revenues of $24.1B. Our FY16 Bear Case assumes 178m iPhones, 17m Apple Watches, and services revenues of $22.1B. Our FY19 Apple Car scenario assumes 200K shipments at an average price of $55,000 per car for revenues of $11B. Even after applying a 20% OPM, we think Apple Car would only contribute $0.32 of EPS.

Google started its Car development in 2009, and at this point has completed over 1m miles of road- testing, which represents ~75 years of driving experience. We believe Google is working with major auto part suppliers such as Roush, Bosch, Continental, FRIMO, LG Electronics, Prefix, RCO, ZF Lenksysteme, etc. We believe Google plans to enable a number of third party car makers with its technology for self-driving cars. Consistent with Googleâ€™s prior efforts with Android for example, we expect Google to target expansion of its core business model of search advertising using the Car as its new platform.

In addition to a fundamental shift to an electric powertrain, Google Car is equipped with a variety of advanced sensors and computing technology. We believe Google Car is capable of driving itself without human intervention (aka â€œautonomous navigationâ€), and is designed with the goal of enabling broader deployment of autonomous navigation. We believe Google is using a combination of advanced computer vision, high-definition mapping, and redundant sensors like RADAR and LIDAR to enable autonomous navigation.

In our view, Googleâ€™s existing ~25 car prototype fleet is not eventually destined for production. We donâ€™t think Google intends to sell cars, although this could certainly change over time. Rather, we believe the prototype fleet exists merely as a development, testing, and proof-of-concept platform. We think it is more likely that Google would sell its software (and perhaps sensors) to the auto manufacturers, who would integrate Googleâ€™s solution into their own vehicles. This strategy would be much more in-line with the standard Google playbook of developing useful software that is designed to become ubiquitous. This is the same strategy Google has used to pursue the smartphone / hardware market to-date. Remember, Google has dabbled (to the tune of $12.5B) in hardware before with Motorola, and we believe it is not in Googleâ€™s core competency to produce cars at scale. Even Googleâ€™s â€˜referenceâ€™ Nexus devices are outsourced to a 3rd party like LG. Google is currently testing their Chart 8: Google Self-Driving Car Project Timeline and Data Points technology in Mountain View, Date            Update California and Austin, Texas.                      2009            Google started testing their self-driving technology with the Toyota Prius on freeways in California. 2012            Google began testing with the Lexus RX450h. At this point, they had completed over 300,000 miles of testing on freeways. 2012+           Google shifted focus to city streets, a much more complex environment than freeways. 2014            Google unveiled an early construction of their new prototype vehicle. Itâ€™s designed from the ground up to be fully self-driving. December 2014   Delivered the first real build of their prototype vehicle. Googleâ€™s self-driving fleet consists of the following vehicles: ï‚§     23 Lexus RX450h SUVs â€“ currently self-driving on public streets in Mountain View and Austin. ï‚§     25 prototype cars â€“ 5 are currently self-driving on public streets in Mountain View Miles driven single start of Googleâ€™s project in 2009: ï‚§     Autonomous mode: 1,158,818 miles ï‚§     Manual mode: 877,477 miles ï‚§     Currently averaging 10K autonomous miles per week on public streets.

The system uses advanced sensors (lasers, radars, and cameras), which are designed to detect objects as far as two football fields away in all directions, including pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles â€“ or even things like fluttering plastic bags and rogue birds. But the secret sauce is in the software, which is not a surprise given Googleâ€™s prowess in this area. For example, bicycles are treated as a special category of moving object. Google can identify cyclist hand signals, which allow the car to predict lane changes. Additionally, the car is designed to handle many other unique situations like construction zones and emergency vehicles. For example, when Google detects an ambulance approaching an intersection the car will remain stopped even though the light turned green.

We assume auto makers sell roughly ~90MM units worldwide, growing to ~103MM by 2018. We are particularly interested in the number of cars sold into the developed world, and we run a sensitivity analysis around the percent of developed market cars that could license Google technology. Additionally, our sensitivity assumes a per-car license fee between $100 and $1,000. Using this, our base case revenue impact is $790MM in 2017, growing to $2.0B by2018.

Googleâ€™s public commentary suggests its primary interest might be in enabling third party car makers to make more advanced cars capable of autonomous navigation. In other words, Google does not seem to be interested in building its own Cars; but that could change over time. We believe Car represents a â€œmulti-screenâ€ opportunity for Apple (and Google) to capture greater consumer mindshare and wallet share, and Apple would be unlikely to ignore the Car threat from Google. Lack of presence in Car could start to loosen the grip Apple currently enjoys over consumers, with iOS. We also believe that incumbent premium car makers including BMW, Daimler, Audi, and Tesla are accelerating their plans to introduce Electric Vehicles capable of autonomous navigation, driven in part by potential threats from Apple and Google. We think this means Apple is working against the clock to some extent, if it wants to take credit for bringing truly revolutionary changes to the Car market. page 12 of 68                                                                           Sundeep Bajikar, Equity Analyst, (415) 229-1552, sbajikar@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 64 - 68 of this report. 533 AAPL Estimate Change September 23, 2015 iPhone is Maturing, Investors are Nervous The chart shows Trending data from Chart 16: Google Trends: iPhone Product Cycle comparison ex-China Google Trends, comparing consumer interest in iPhone 6s with that for iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s. 100 iPhone 6 Given Googleâ€™s limited presence in                                           90                                     iPhone interest ex- China, we think the data are                                                                                          China declining probably not fully capturing Chinese 80 consumer interest in iPhone.                                                 70 Relative Weighting 60                                                                              iPhone 5 Trending data show a potentially troubling trend both for major and                                           50 minor (â€œsâ€) iPhone launches, with interest levels declining.                                                   40 iPhone 4s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                iPhone 6s 30                                                                                                                                       iPhone 5s 20 10 0 2010-09-26 2011-01-16 2011-05-08 2011-08-28 2011-12-18 2012-04-08 2012-07-29 2012-11-18 2013-03-10 2013-06-30 2013-10-20 2014-02-09 2014-06-01 2014-09-21 2015-01-11 2015-05-03 2015-08-23 Source: Google Trends (ex-China), Jefferies This chart shows that cumulative                   Chart 17: iPhone Cumulative Interest Peaked in 2012 ex-China consumer interest in iPhone ex-China peaked in 2012, around the launch                   100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          iP. 6 of iPhone 5.

We compare the total cost of ownership (TCO) of new iPhones under Appleâ€™s plan with the device plans offered by carriers and find the iPhone Upgrade Program to be better or in line with carrier installment plan pricing. For 12 month upgraders we calculate that the iPhone Upgrade program is 9% less expensive than the cheapest carrier device plan in the market. On a 24 month basis Appleâ€™s plan is in line with the carriers. If the consumer chooses a mobile protection plan from a carrier instead of AppleCare+, the TCO under Appleâ€™s plan comes out 9% lower over a 24 month period. The only scenario where Apple is more expensive is when the user upgrades at 18 months since Apple does not allow for this in their plan and even then Appleâ€™s plan comes out just 9% higher. Note that we compare the carrier installment plans with both AppleCare+ and the carriersâ€™ own protection plans (either/or). The carrier protection plan TCOs are higher but we point out that these include the replacement of a phone (at a cost) in the case it is lost or stolen where Appleâ€™s plan does not cover this. Quick Summary of Appleâ€™s iPhone Upgrade Program Apple launched its new iPhone Upgrade Program in the US along with its announcement of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The 24 month installment plan starts at $32 per month for the base level 16GB iPhone 6S, and also includes the AppleCare+ extended warranty that covers incidental damage and allows for two replacements/repairs for $79 each. After at least 12 installments, the customer gets the option to upgrade to a new iPhone and extend their payments for another two years assuming they return their old iPhone to Apple. Monthly payments range from $32.41/month for the 16GB iPhone 6S up to $44.91/month for the 128GB iPhone 6S+. Table 1: Apple: iPhone Upgrade Pricing $ per month iPhone 6S      iPhone 6S Plus 16GB               $32.41              $36.58 64GB               $36.58              $40.75 128GB              $40.75              $44.91 Source: Apple. We believe that Appleâ€™s Ts & Cs suggest that Citizens Bank is providing the lease financing to Apple Payment Plan customers. Consumers make their first installment of $32.41 or higher (depending on the device) through their credit card and then Citizens Bank automatically charges monthly payments under the installment loan. At any time six (6) months after the date of enrollment, consumers can become upgrade eligible by making advance payments so that they have paid the equivalent of at least twelve (12) installment payments under the installment loan. While Apple has not made this explicit we believe that the risk of default on the plan rests with Citizens Bank and not with Apple. We hope for further clarification on this point on Appleâ€™s next earnings call. 2 7 Rod Hall, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-415) 315-6713          15 September 2015 rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com Apple TCO Assuming AppleCare+ To provide a like for like cost comparison from a consumerâ€™s point of view we assume first that users all take AppleCare+ regardless of who they buy their phone from. We calculate that Appleâ€™s iPhone Upgrade program is cheaper than carrier device plans should consumers want to upgrade their iPhones more frequently than every 18-24 months. In this section of our analysis we assume that a consumer would purchase AppleCare+ instead of a carrierâ€™s mobile payment plan along with a new iPhone 6s/6s+. We calculate that an iPhone purchased under Appleâ€™s program would result in a 9% lower TCO than the least expensive carrier device plan should a user upgrades his/her iPhone every 12 months. However, if the user wishes to upgrade at the 18 month point, we estimate the Appleâ€™s plan would cost 9% more than the cheapest carrier plan. If a consumer upgrades his/her iPhone every two years then the TCO under Appleâ€™s plan ends up in line with the carriers assuming the consumer buys AppleCare+ with each plan. Figure 1: TCOs of Carrier Plans vs. Appleâ€™s Program assuming AppleCare+ purchases $800 $667                       $649 $641 $641 $641 $640 $700 $584                        $583 $600                                                   $534          $534 $500        $455 $428 $445 $428 $389 $400 $300 $200 $100 $0 TCO 12 months                       TCO 18 months                          TCO 24 months AT&T       Verizon   T-Mobile       Sprint        Apple Upgrade Program Source: J.P. Morgan, Company reports, Apple Overall, while there is some variation in plan TCOs, we see that Appleâ€™s plan cost is relatively close to that of the four major US carriers depending on the timing of the upgrade. Combining this with the ease of doing business with Apple and the fact that the Apple plan includes an unlocked phone that will work on any network we believe that Apple will end up with a good number of customers moving onto their plans. We remind readers, however, that Apple has far fewer distribution points in the US which probably limits their eventual share to some extent. As shown in Figure 2 below, we calculate that the TCO under the iPhone Upgrade Program is lower than the TCOs under carrier device plans at 12 months while at 24 months it is in line with carrier deals. This should incent earlier upgrades for some users thus shortening upgrade cycles though it is hard to know just how many people will take Apple up on this. In almost all other cases, we calculate that the consumer would end up paying more under the iPhone Upgrade Program than the most economical carrier device plan. The figure below shows how Appleâ€™s Upgrade Program stacks up vs. other carrier device plans for upgrade points from 12 to 24 months. Note that our TCO calculations compare the cost to the consumer up to the point of upgrade. We could equally look at these numbers on a monthly basis to get some idea for how much more expensive it is to upgrade your phone every 12 months compared to every 24 months. We also question just how many users will really be willing to pay in the ballpark of $400/year to keep themselves in shiny new phones. We believe the jury is still out on whether installment plans reduce 3 8"

If Apple launches the program globally, every 10% iPhone user adoption will boost CY17 shipments by 24M units or $0.90 of EPS. Apple can potentially leverage partners (Brightstar in the US and Foxconn in China) to resell the one- year old iPhones in the second-hand market, which helps address price points the new iPhones can not, especially after discontinuing the iPhone 5c. In addition, iPhones sold in Apple Stores carry higher gross margins absent the typical 3rd party retail discount. While this program could become quite popular, we believe there is some limit to adoption as carriers also have leasing programs and some users may not value AppleCare+ or the ability to switch carriers.

Pricing on the device starts at $799 for the 32GB Wi-Fi model, $949 for 128GB Wi-Fi model and $1,079 for 128GB Wi-Fi + LTE model. The company also announced two new Accessories â€“ Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. The iPad Pro is expected to be available in November. We believe that the new iPad plus iOS 9 features positions Apple well to take share in $500-$1,000 laptop category which we estimated to be a $63bn market opportunity (click here for our April 2014 iAnywhere report).

Morgan Assuming that Apple ships 19m iPad Pros and iPad Air2s in CY16 blended ASP of $674, we calculate a 0.6% positive impact to our CY16 EPS. Our assumption of 19m laptop replacement iPads in 2016 equates to ~20% share in the $500-$1000 laptop category â€“ a rapid move to high penetration but possible in our opinion. Our ASP estimate of $674 assumes that iPad Pro at $800 makes up 12m of the 19m units and iPad Air2 at $500 makes up rest of the shipments. Our assumption of 12m units of iPad Pro corresponds to MacBook Air units that are likely to get cannibalized in 2016.

Apple said that the A9X is faster than 80% of portable PCs that were shipped in the last 12 months and its GPU is faster than 90% of portable PCs. Based on updated information from Apple and other industry websites, we estimate that the multicore performance of the A9X now closely matches the performance of Intelâ€™s chip in the MacBook Air. We expect Apple to update its iPad Air with the same A9X chip later this Fall and potentially to add peripheral compatibility though we see the keyboard as less interesting than the Pencil.

We liked Apple's progress in Watch, iPad, and TV, but were underwhelmed by iPhone 6s.

Avg. Daily Vol.:               56,463,732 Apple is in Transition. The Smartphone market is maturing, Android capabilities are just as good if not better than iOS, and competition from China is intensifying (Charts 2, 3), while Samsung is focused on differentiation with flexible display. Meanwhile Google is extending its lead in Cloud Services and advancing its technology for self-driving Cars. To extend its brand advantage, particularly in China, Apple needs to introduce new categories of products/services, a process that Apple has begun with the Watch, Apple Pay, and iPad Pro. Lower iPhone hype/expectations (Charts 4, 5) combined with new offerings would make AAPL stock more attractive to us. Our FY16 EPS estimate increased to $9.71 (from $9.58) primarily due to higher effect of share repurchases at lower stock prices.

First, we present the underlying assumptions in our user base adoption model which result in our current 2016 growth forecast of 7.9%. In this case we believe that many are missing the true size of the iPhone base as well as the size of what we call â€œnatural adoptersâ€ who use a first hand phone. In our second approach we take a top down look at the $400+ smartphone category and Appleâ€™s share in it. Here we note that this category continues to grow and that Apple has jumped to 65% share of this market as a result of the launch of larger iPhones. We believe some investors are implicitly assuming that Appleâ€™s share reverts to a mean of ~50% of this category. However, current momentum suggests that this is unlikely. In our base case we assume that the iPhone maintains its present 65% share of this category. This is particularly likely, in our opinion, given that the larger screen iPhone6/6+ should drop by $100 in price this year (that point also makes $400 the right market breakpoint for ASP in our opinion). This case results in iPhone unit growth of 5.6% in 2016 to 242.7m units. The â€œnatural adopters baseâ€ of upgraders In our September 2014 report (link), we detailed our iPhone base modelling approach. In this report, we are updating our analysis as we try to answer the question of whether iPhones can continue to grow in FY16. We believe that there is a â€œnaturalâ€ base of iPhone users that are most likely to upgrade and contribute to iPhone shipments and a â€œhanded downâ€ base of users who indirectly contribute to shipments by providing a market for used phones. The presence of a strong handed down market also suggests that the overall base size of the iPhone market is higher than some observers believe in our opinion. We estimate that the natural adopters base of iPhone users was 407m prior to the launch of iPhone 6 and 6s in September, 2014 and the total base (including natural and handed down users) was 529m. 2 134 Rod Hall, CFA                                            North America Equity Research (1-415) 315-6713                                         08 September 2015 rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com Figure 1: iPhone: Natural Adopters and Total base 800,000 700,000 600,000 500,000 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000 - CQ1-11E CQ2-11E CQ3-11E CQ4-11E CQ1-12E CQ2-12E CQ3-12E CQ4-12E CQ1-13E CQ2-13E CQ3-13E CQ4-13E CQ1-14E CQ2-14E CQ3-14E CQ4-14E CQ1-15E CQ2-15E iPhone's Natural Adopters Base (000s)        iPhone's Total Base (000s) Source: J.P. Morgan estimates. Implied upgrades based on Apple % indications and our model Embedded in our current iPhone forecasts is our assumption that 65% of the natural adopters base will have upgraded to large screen iPhones by the end of CQ4â€™16. We estimate that ~30% of this natural base had already upgraded to newer iPhones as of the end of CQ2â€™15. In CQ4â€™15 alone, we are assuming that an additional 6% of the base upgrades. We believe this assumption is achievable and note that it is slightly below the 7% of the base that had upgraded in CQ4â€™14. We also note that the base size Apple calculates their % upgraded numbers on was the static base prior to the launch of the iPhone6/6+ while the base of smaller screen phones continues to grow slightly. 3 135 Rod Hall, CFA                                              North America Equity Research (1-415) 315-6713                                           08 September 2015 rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com Figure 2: Upgrades as % of modeled iPhone Base 70%                                                                                                                                                                         65% 60% 60%                                                                                                                                       55% 50% 50% 43% 40%                                                                                  37% 30% 30% 23% 20%                          14% 10%          7% 0% CQ3-14A          CQ4-14A          CQ1-15A                CQ2-15A           CQ3-15E       CQ4-15E            CQ1-16E           CQ2-16E          CQ3-16E            CQ4-16E JPMe of upgrades as % of Natural Adopters Base Source: Company reports and J.P.

The company currently trades slightly above its three-year median FY2E P/E of 11.5x; we believe AAPL deserves a premium multiple based on its refreshed product cycle, strengthened ecosystem, and upbeat prospects on new products. KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases. Andrew Uerkwitz: 212 667-5316 2 161"

Our checks Shares Out. (MM):                  5,773.0 in Asia suggest Apple is benefiting from brand power, and the component supply chain remains optimistic about iPhone's ability to take share. However, industry watchers have                     Float (MM):                        5,699.6 become somewhat concerned by the recent stock market correction in China.

Lower Investor Expectations. At current trading levels, we believe AAPL stock is baking in NTM EPS power of ~$8.50 (vs. JEF: $9.47 and Street: $9.64), which translates into roughly 20m lower iPhone shipments (see Chart 1) - in other words, we think the recent stock correction is probably overdone. However, unless Apple can deliver meaningful progress in brand fortification through new product categories such as Watch, iPad Pro, Car, or Cloud Services, or further increase cash returns to investors, the stock would remain at the mercy of iPhone/China sentiment near-term.

Arthurâ€™s notes are linked here: Hon Hai Downgrade, and Pegatron Downgrade. Separately, Largan reported July monthly revenue of NT$5,255m (+50% YoY, see Chart 2). We believe Largan is the primary supplier of the iPhone 6s camera lens and derives a significant percentage of its revenue from Apple. Largan was the primary supplier of the camera lens for iPhone 6 as well. After initial media and investor speculation about Larganâ€™s August revenue guidance, the company clarified that it had not provided official guidance for August. Our checks on the ground in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul and Tokyo suggest iPhone is enjoying robust consumer demand. However, given stock market worries (since late-June) in China, we would not be surprised if Apple was taking a more cautious view of end demand, and cutting iPhone-related orders in the supply chain. Our checks also continue to suggest that iPhone is facing strong competition in China, primarily from Huawei, Xiaomi, and Samsung. Samsung is cutting Galaxy S6/Edge prices, and launching two new premium phones on Aug 13, so we expect competition for iPhone to increase further. page 3 of 17                                                                                                         Sundeep Bajikar, Equity Analyst, (415) 229-1552, sbajikar@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 14 - 17 of this report. 223"

In Defense of Apple Summary Appleâ€™s share price declined 12.5% from its recent high of $132, following a consensus- beating F3Q15 and strong outlook into F4Q15. We believe the weakness can be attributed to fear of decelerating iPhone growth, concerns for a slowing Chinese economy, and lack of new revenue drivers. We argue that discounting Apple based on those concerns is unjustified and this note explains in detail why Apple's growth potential is under- appreciated. However, the biggest risk to our bullish thesis is a major shift in tech investor sentiment, away from smartphone-centered names. Growth in China Not Over China will overtake the US as the largest iPhone market in 2015: although Apple does not disclose unit sales by region, we estimated that Chinaâ€™s overall iPhone installed based is approaching, if not already exceeded, that of the US. IDC estimated that the US iPhone installed base will grow 12% Y/Y in 2015 to 114M units. Our estimates showed that installed base in China grew 43% Y/Y as of 2Q15, more than 3x the growth rate of the US. We estimate that the iPhoneâ€™s installed base in China has reached 111M units as of 2Q15. In reference, data analytics firm App Annie reported that China surpassed the US in iOS App Store downloads in 1Q15. If we use App Store downloads as a proxy for the installed base size, China may have exceeded the US in user base as early as 1Q15. We do not think smartphone demand in China has been â€œpulled forwardâ€ in recent quarters due to screen size upgrades. We believe the iPhoneâ€™s installed base in China will consistently grow at multiples of overall market rate, when Chinese smartphone users transition from basic, price-driven smartphone purchases, to premium, experience-driven smartphone ownership. Current iPhone installed base implies plenty of upside to Street estimates: based on our global iPhone installed base estimate of 580M, 2.25-year replacement cycle, and 90% user retention rate, we believe the current iPhone user base alone can sustainably generate 230M unit demandâ€”the same as FY15 consensus estimates of total iPhone shipment. The exhibit below shows that compared to the United States, the iPhone is significantly under-penetrated in China despite its larger share (22% vs. 7%) of the mobile user base, indicating material upside potential for new iPhone unit growth in China. Exhibit 1: Estimated 2015 iPhone Installed Base (unit in 000s) Source: IDC (October 2014), Gartner (July 2015), Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Chinese smartphone users are upgrading to a premium experience: dynamic market conditions in China are building and breaking consumer stereotypes at less than 12-month intervals. We believe Chinese users are upgrading to mid-/high-end models and brands. 18 months ago, Xiaomi initiated a price war with its Redmi phone, dragging mid-end hardware to the $130-or-below range. Four months ago, LeTV pushed the price war to an extreme, announcing phones priced below bill-of-materials cost. LeTVâ€™s price aggression hardly helped its sales. On the contrary, we are seeing the Chinese market turning to higher ASP, premium phones. Huawei reported record profit for its consumer handheld division in 1H15, due to its very successful high-end penetration since last fall (sales were 2 239"

In addition to potentially posing higher competition for Macs and the upcoming iPad Pro, we think Win10 could also rekindle excitement in PCs, particularly through newer form factors like the Microsoft Surface family of products. Attractive New User Interface. We think Windows users, including those that adopted an iPad or Android Tablet due to their simpler U/I, are likely to find the new Windows 10 U/I visually appealing, well organized, and less confusing when compared to Windows 8. We found Cortana easy to set up and use, with accurate voice recognition built in. When combined with Microsoft's growing investments in Cloud Services, we think Cortana has potential to rival Google Now over time, while Apple remains further behind in this area. Superior Integration of Touch/Stylus and Keyboard. Windows 10 features a Tablet mode, which can be automatically switched by attaching or removing a keyboard. Microsoft's new Edge browser allows inking directly on webpages, a useful new feature that is not natively available in iOS or Android. We found switching applications in Tablet mode to be easier in Windows 10 compared to Windows 8. Seamless Upgrade Process. Windows 10 became available promptly as promised on 7/29, in the morning. Starting the upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro was easy, and the entire upgrade process took only 30 minutes. Importantly, none of our preinstalled applications (including Microsoft Office, Citrix Receiver, Chrome browser, Factset, Netflix, Adobe Reader Touch, etc.) needed to be reinstalled, all of our personal data, files, and settings were migrated over, and all of the system hardware worked flawlessly after the upgrade. Potential to Rekindle Excitement in PC. Investor sentiment around PCs and expectations from Windows 10 remain low. We think potential excitement around Windows 10 would be most positive for MU, Samsung, SNDK, and INTC, with neutral to slightly negative implications for iPad and Mac. Links to Related Reports.

AAPL, AAPL US Price: $130.75 FQ3'15 Wrap: FQ3 beat and slight miss on guidance Price Target: $145.00 due to opex. Ests up on better iPhone ASP. Reit. OW. Apple delivered a slight beat in FQ3 in spite of continuing FX headwinds but guided                     Telecom & Networking slightly weak due mainly to higher than expected opex. iPhone inventory was down by                     Equipment/IT Hardware 600k units but this was in line with the Q/Q drop seen in FQ3â€™13 after the launch of                    Rod Hall, CFA AC the iPhone5. No mention of demand weakness was made on the call and China results                       (1-415) 315-6713 and commentary were positive. Better than expected iPhone ASPs actually drive a                         rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com slight increase in our forecasts. We see the overnight selloff in the shares as overdone                Bloomberg JPMA HALL <GO> considering all of this and would use any weakness in trading to add to holdings.                       Ashwin Kesireddy (1-415) 315-6756 ï‚· Slightly weak guidance. Apple guided FQ4 revenues of $49bn-$51bn which were a                         ashwin.x.kesireddy@jpmorgan.com small 1.1% below our estimate at midpoint. Gross margin guidance of 38.5%-39/5%                       J.P. Morgan Securities LLC was also in line. However, higher opex than we had modeled drove implied EPS Price Performance guidance ~8% below our forecast.                                                                           140 ï‚· Strong iPhone ASPs. iPhone ASP came in at $660 â€“ 7.4% better than our forecast                             120 and flat Q/Q. This compares to an average FQ3 Q/Q decline of 5.1% over the last                        $ 100 three years. We believe the improvement was likely due to increasing mix of higher ASP iPhone 6+ demand in EMs.                                                                                80 Jul-14     Oct-14   Jan-15   Apr-15    Jul-15 ï‚· Inventory decline.

Apple said that â€œwell over 100%â€ of the Y/Y revenue growth in Other Products was driven by Apple Watch. We calculate that this implies that Apple shipped over 2m Watches in FQ3 in line with our forecast for 2.1m units. ï‚· China commentary upbeat. Appleâ€™s revenue from China was up 112% Y/Y. Tim Cookâ€™s commentary on the call suggested, in our opinion, that Apple has yet to see any demand weakness there. We believe Apple may have trimmed their FQ4 guidance for macro but note that management did not comment on this on the call. ï‚· Forecast changes and valuation: We are increasing our FY16 EPS estimate by a slight 2% to $10.35, by increasing our iPhone ASP estimate and gross margin assumption. We are establishing our Dec â€™16 price target of $145 based on 13.4x CY16 PE (11.2x ex. cash). Apple Inc.

Daily Vol.:               46,624,572 is facing strong competition on a technology basis, from lower-priced Android-powered Smartphones, particularly from Huawei and Xiaomi. However, our checks also suggest consumers in China have favored iPhone over premium offerings from Samsung or lower- priced domestic alternatives, due to Apple's superior brand image. Apple's Smartphone market share in China has stepped up from ~6% to 18% over the last 9 months, and compares with 37%, 21%, 45%, and 34% in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Korea, respectively. We Could Become More Constructive with evidence that Apple is fortifying its brand through superior technology and/or value, potentially through new product categories (e.g., electric car), success in Watch, or Cloud Services. We maintain our $135 PT and think a selloff would make the stock incrementally more attractive due to lower expectations.

This particular Apple store is located in a premium shopping district in Shanghai, surrounded by luxury brand retail stores. The Apple Store was noticeably busy on both levels. There were no Apple sales agents available to greet visitors, as the limited number of agents on site were tied up with customers. Our checks in Shanghai support our view that Apple is benefiting from superior brand recognition in China. We believe Appleâ€™s strong brand image might be swaying middle- class consumers in China away from domestic, lower-priced but capable alternatives. We believe Appleâ€™s plans to expand its retail store footprint in China by an additional 40 stores by mid-next year would seek to maximize Appleâ€™s brand power in China. We believe Apple is competing primarily with Huawei and Xiaomi in addition to Samsung in China. Source: Jefferies. Pictures processed to blur identities of individuals. We believe strong competition from iPhone 6/6+ has prompted Samsung to move up its Galaxy Note 5 launch to August 13 (from September). Our checks suggest Samsung will aim to surprise positively, in part through the number of new Smartphone/Smartwatch models it announces at its event scheduled in New York. page 3 of 21                                                                            Sundeep Bajikar, Equity Analyst, (415) 229-1552, sbajikar@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 18 - 21 of this report. 381 AAPL Estimate Change July 22, 2015 Chart 2: ZTEâ€™s iPhone-like Blade S6 Plus The chart shows pictures of ZTEâ€™s iPhone-like Blade S6 Plus Smartphone. We were impressed with ZTEâ€™s attention to detail in mimicking the iPhoneâ€™s looks, including an inscription on the back saying â€œDesigned by ZTE in California Assembled in Chinaâ€. We found the ZTE phone to be attractive, light, responsive, and easy to use. We believe the phone is available to buy in China for the equivalent of under $350.

Apple F3Q15 Preview Summary: Apple reports F3Q15 results next Tuesday (7/21), and we expect another beat-and-raise quarter driven by strong iPhone sales. This is significant given lighter than expected handset sales from Samsung. We see it as further evidence that more consumers are choosing mobile computing platforms rather than handset features. We believe Android-based devices lack a cohesive platformâ”€we continue to expect the bifurcated results to continue to become more pronounced. In fact, we believe we are seeing the beginning of the end of the Android flagship phones. Like Apple's dominance of the high-end PC market, the same is being repeated in the handset market. We would be buyers in front of the quarter. Key Points iOS Platform Attraction Will Continue to Grow: We are seeing a widening gap between iOS and Android platforms. For iOS users, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Watch are all seamlessly integrated with iPhones. And those integrated software and services often represent the best-in-class option for payment, music streaming, media management, and wearable. For Android users, however, we see fundamentally misaligned interests between the infrastructure provider (Google) and hardware OEMs (Samsung, LG, HTC). The disconnect between operating system and hardware, or OEMsâ€™ lack of control over handsetsâ€™ mobile operating system, will continue to exacerbate the fragmentation problem for the Android ecosystem, which has been one of the main reasons for inferior user experience on Android devices. We do not expect Appleâ€™s software and services to materially impact its top/bottom line yet, but collectively they will help sustain the share gain story for iOS devices. Growth in China: We believe fear is overblown on Chinaâ€™s recent stock market volatility and its impact on consumer spending on Apple products. We view Apple as an underpenetrated player in China. We expect two drivers to increase Appleâ€™s penetration in China: 1) major retail store expansion in the next two years (largest number of new store openings outside of the US) and 2) a more sophisticated smartphone user base that values user experience and ecosystem over hardware features.

Inc. Although China already has a higher number of Apple Stores than most countries outside of the US, we believe it remains a severely underpenetrated market given Chinaâ€™s rapidly growing middle-class population and scale of the market. 2 432 Apple Inc.

Inc. Shrinking High-end Android Share: Global tier-1 OEMs such as Samsung, LG, Motorola, Sony, and HTC proved that there is a high-end Android market based on differentiated, premium-quality hardware. Apple almost eliminated the difference (screen size), and that market is shrinking. We believe the high-end Android phones with iPhone- like ASP will continue to shrink, and the category will eventually redefine itself with lower price points similar to flagship phones made by Chinese OEMs, in the $600-and-below range. In other words, OEMs like Samsung and LG will slowly exit the Apple-like price range for their flagships, just as Chinese OEMs like Huawei and Xiaomi move up the hierarchy, but still at a discount to iPhones. This scenario is quite similar to the notebook market, where only MacBook dominates the high-end. While high-end Windows laptops do still exist, no one can ship at a scale similar to Appleâ€™s. In fact, Apple is the only one shipping â€œluxuryâ€ at scale; no one else manages to do that consistently. Apple Watch: We believe the initial sales results of Apple Watch will have minimum impact on Appleâ€™s near-term performance and our long-term bullish outlook on the product category itself. We have seen more media coverage on â€œweakeningâ€ sales momentum of the Watch. We are not concerned. First, there is no reliable, official data on Apple Watch sales; second, initial sales and shipment are poor indicators of the long-term performance. Take Appleâ€™s most successful products, iPod and iPhone, for example; within the first four months since their launch, fewer than 400,000 iPods, 1.3M iPhones were shipped. Our FY15 Apple Watch unit projection is 6M units, noticeably lower than the Streetâ€™s 9M. For FY16, our projection of 25M units is also lower than the consensus estimate of 29M units. We fully explained our long-term bullish view on Apple Watch in our in-depth analysis Watch Apple Change Computing, Again, published in April this year. Our view has not changed since. To reiterate, we believe the Watch represents the future of our mobile computing experience; the Watch is more than a piece of wearable hardware. It is an interface, a service layer between a central computing device (smartphone) and IoT (peripheral connected devices). It is better perceived as an app running in the background on our wrist, constantly listening, preparing to wake up for the user, or be triggered by other apps and devices. It is personal and contextual by nature. We see the Apple Watch as a digital ""concierge""â€”the primary interface between users and a myriad of connected hardware devices consumers will add to their lives, which ultimately constitute their unique IoT ecosystems. Model Changes: Based on stronger iPhone unit sales estimates, we raised our F3Q15 and FY15 revenues/EPS from $47.4B/$1.66 and $231.0/$8.94 to $48.7B/$1.73 and $232.4B/$9.01. We are slightly below consensus estimates of $49.2B/$1.80 (F3Q15) and 3 433"

Early build plans for 6s indicate roughly flat Y/Y unit growth compared to the 6.

Apple Watch demand sustaining at a healthy level after initial spike. We are launching our AlphaWise Watch Tracker, which indicates interest level (proxy for demand) in the product five and six weeks after launch is about 20% higher than the first-generation iPhone in mid-2007 (Exhibit 2). Watch interest Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with in the week of launch was about half that for the first iPhone, but the Watch         companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, has seen a much smaller deceleration since the initial spike.

Investor expectations for iPhone and Watch growth are low. There is little conviction that iPhone units can grow in FY16 (roughly the 6s cycle), and that the first-generation Watch will gain traction. While we anticipate iPhone growth will decelerate from FY15 and it could take some time for users and developers to find more compelling use cases for the Watch, our surveys and trackers have consistently showed stronger than expected demand for both products over the next few quarters. As Apple approaches the next iPhone cycle and build data points remain stronger than expected, we believe slight positive earnings revision and multiple expansion could drive the stock towards our $166 base case (17x CY15 EPS of $9.73). Our bull case of $195 incorporates more iPhone and Watch upside, and Services growth, which should drive further multiple expansion (19x CY15 EPS of $10.25). 4662"

We believe pre-order mix was ~60/40 in favor of S6 Edge, and Samsung is likely to benefit from demand favoring the S6 Edge, assuming Samsung fully resolves supply shortages by the end of this month. Overall, we model S6 shipments of 47m units for CY15. page 3 of 29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Sundeep Bajikar, Equity Analyst, (415) 229-1552, sbajikar@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 26 - 29 of this report. 538 AAPL Estimate Change June 8, 2015 Chart 5 suggests Samsung has not increased marketing/promotional activity with the launch of S6/Edge. This is also consistent with our checks, and Samsungâ€™s recent commentary. Chart 7 suggests that overall Smartphone volume sentiment is neutral. Chart 8 suggests Smartphone retail channels are not expecting major price cuts.

OW With the WWDC Keynote coming up next Monday we roll out multiple pieces of in-                          Telecom & Networking depth AppleTV analysis. Firstly, we see the console gaming opportunity for Apple as                     Equipment/IT Hardware material with better hardware and an app store exposing the company to the $35bn                        Rod Hall, CFA AC console game software market. Although reportedly delayed we also assess the likely                     (1-415) 315-6713 EPS impact of an OTT TV service. In addition to AppleTV we expect updates on                            rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com HomeKit, streaming Music and possibly our iAnywhere thesis. Reiterate Overweight.

We believe the AppleTV is likely to see a software update that will make it a HomeKit hub. As a result we expect further partner announcements at WWDC and potentially some expanded HomeKit functionality in updated iOS/Watch/OSX SDKs. ï‚· Music streaming. Like most we expect a music streaming announcement though we are more skeptical of the potential for such a service. We believe that the materiality of impact is likely to be small in any event. ï‚· iAnywhere and other thoughts. Given everything that we expect at WWDC this year, we believe our iAnywhere thesis probably ends up waiting until 2016. However, we continue to believe Apple will roll this out and that the earnings impact is likely to be material (link). Apple Inc.

This represents a substantial increase in both graphics and processing power for the AppleTV putting it on par with last-gen games consoles as well as mid-range laptop/desktop PCs. With these new hardware capabilities we expect the applications for AppleTV hardware to expand substantially.

Morgan estimates. As shown in Figure 1 below we compare GPU performance in GFLOPS with both current generation and last generation consoles. Though processing power is only one aspect of graphics performance we believe that this shows the A8X to be a very capable chip when it comes to gaming as well as applications like UHD TV. We note that game publishers like Super Evil Megacorp, Gameloft and EPIC games have already demonstrated console quality games using the A8 chip and Appleâ€™s Metal API. Given that the Apple TV will likely be priced significantly less (we expect ~$100) than next generation consoles (~$350 - $400), we believe it will present an interesting option for casual gamers, particularly given the additional TV streaming features we expect the device to offer.

Based on company commentary on earnings calls we estimate annual Apple TV shipments. We then assume a replacement rate of 7 years to arrive at an estimate of the total installed base. We believe that ~10m Apple TV units were shipped in 2013 given that Apple disclosed that it had revenues of ~$1bn from this segment. Apple also commented that it had total shipments of 20m in April 2014 and over 25m in January 2015. Hence, we believe shipments slowed in 2014 given the aging existing hardware combined with persistent rumors of an update coming soon. We present three different scenarios for future Apple TV shipments in Figure 2 below. Due to new gaming, HomeKit hub and TV streaming features we expect a meaningful acceleration in 2016 sales with shipments of 24m in our central case. We also calculate the penetration of Apple TV in total North American and European TVs, leveraging our prior modeling of the total TV installed base. Assuming a TV replacement period of 7 years, we estimate that AppleTV penetration was ~2.4% at the end of 2014. We expect this to increase to 5.0% in 2016 in our central case.

Price $130.28 Google I/O 2015 Implications Key Takeaway We continue to believe Apple needs to raise its game in Cloud Services to combat competition from Google longer term. Google Now on Tap, Google Photos, and Expeditions are examples of three new services that build on Google's Cloud prowess to deliver dramatically more advanced (and economical) capabilities to virtually every Smartphone (and every classroom), rendering device hardware-based differentiation less important, particularly for growth markets in Asia. Dramatically More Advanced Cloud Services. Google Now on Tap serves up context- based intelligence, after interpreting context from a variety of different apps such as WhatsApp or Email, without requiring such apps to change. Google Photos supports natural language context-based searches, which leverage Google's 30-layer deep neural network learning algorithms running in the Cloud. Expeditions brings virtual-reality field trips to virtually every classroom, again leveraging Google's investments and innovation in Cloud technology. Advances in data compression and web-page rendering optimization for slower connections also make the internet more accessible to the next wave of mobile users from less developed markets in Asia or Africa. Google Now on Tap = Lower App or OS Fragmentation. Apple's iOS app ecosystem is revered as a money-making machine by developers. While we believe Google's Play Store revenues are growing faster (off a lower base) than iOS app store, Google Now on Tap signals a more fundamental shift away from a litany of apps powered by disconnected data sources, to a more context-aware and unified Cloud Service that over time could make device-based apps less relevant. At ~1m apps each, we think the last thing either iOS or Android ecosystems need is new apps. With fewer apps to install/update, or to switch across, we think user experience could improve dramatically. This in turn would also minimize divergence in capabilities across different versions of the Android OS installed on devices. Can Cloud Services Trump Hardware? As mobile usage models increasingly migrate to the Cloud, catalyzed by growing adoption of hardware-lite devices like Smartwatches, we expect more of the user experience to be increasingly driven by superior Cloud Services such as Google Now. This represents a longer term threat to Apple's hardware-centric business model. In the near term, we expect AAPL stock to remain well supported by positive China iPhone data points, and ongoing share repurchases. We wouldn't be surprised if Apple announced advancements in Cloud Services at WWDC. Expect Transition to Flexible Display. While mobile device-based differentiation overall would be challenged by growing importance of Cloud Services, we think device form factor innovation driven by flexible display is likely to prove more important over time, as a key enabler of new consumption models for next-generation Cloud Services.

But over the next nine months we believe the sentiment on Apple will changeâ€”we expect investors to start wondering if the company can deliver the same growth with several quarters of tough comps aheadâ€”a very ""what-have-you-done-for-me-lately"" mindset. In fact, we believe some will argue that Apple will record its first year-over-year decline of iPhone sales in FY15. This could put pressure on the stock as investors may start to believe that the iPhone growth story has run its course. Based on the chart, the stock could test $120- $125 levels. We would be aggressive buyers at those levels. We believe investorsâ€™ fears of declining iPhone sales are premature, and Appleâ€™s market share gain and sales momentum in China will allow the company to beat the tough comp this December quarter. Moreover, we believe Appleâ€™s ecosystem, new product categories, and shareholder friendly actions will keep its earnings growth trajectory above consensus expectations while new revenue growth engines emerge to replace the iPhone. Key Points ï‚·   Street Concern for iPhone Is Premature: why are we optimistic? We believe Apple has stronger earnings growth potential than what Street consensus implies, for two reasons: 1) the current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus product cycle will be stronger than most expect, in our view; and 2) we believe Appleâ€™s EPS growth will continue to decouple from iPhone unit growth with new products, higher margin service revenues, and more shareholder-friendly actions. The steadily increasing iPhone installed base should provide a strong base for Apple to transition to new growth engines. We believe Apple can sustain double-digit EPS growth in the years to come ï‚·   Street Estimates vs. OpCo: the consensus estimate for Appleâ€™s revenue growth (5%) and iPhone shipment (1.5%) in FY16 reflect a very low expectation, which we believe Apple is highly likely to beat. We also conclude that the Street estimates for FY16 EPS of $9.57 underestimate the benefit from share buyback and margin improvement potential of Apple. We model 8% iPhone unit growth (and 8% in the critical December quarter of 2015) which helps lead to our EPS estimate of $10.37 (growing 16% Y/Y). ï‚·   Chinaâ€™s Potential: we expect Appleâ€™s sales momentum in China to continue with incremental market share gain on the high-end phones as well as deeper penetration across product categories. As recently as F2Q15, Appleâ€™s sales in China superseded those in the U.S., officially marking China as the largest market. We believe China has more untapped growth potential for Apple in 2015 and beyond. We expect 20M incremental iPhone unit growth from China in 2015. 2 599"

We increase June quarter iPhone units to 50M from 46M, and increase FY15 and FY16 estimates 5% and 7% to 240M and 249M. We expect slight iPhone unit growth of 4% in FY16 (next iPhone cycle) as our survey earlier in the year indicates strong demand from existing iPhone users, with nearly half of the installed base planning to upgrade in FY16 (Exhibit 3). So far, our survey data tracks closely to Apple's comments that â€œbarely in the teensâ€ percent of the iPhone installed base upgraded to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus by the end of the December quarter, and 20% of the installed base by the March quarter. Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with US Apple Watch demand increased ~60% since March. Apple Watch                        companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

We raise our base case Watch estimates by 20% from 30M in the first 12 months to 36M. We believe this remains a conservative estimate of demand given 1) it implies only â€œdefinitelyâ€ buy responses convert to purchases as opposed to those that said â€œprobablyâ€ which we include in the bull case, 2) it assumes 50% US mix despite current iPhone installed base mix closer to 30%, and 3) it doesn't consider the increasing iPhone installed base since the beginning of the year. However, we believe supply will significantly undershoot demand in the first six months, making our base case the most realistic outcome for shipments near-term. In fact, we leave our Watch unit estimates unchanged in the June and September quarters, and increased December and March quarters by a total of 6M units. EPS estimates move higher. FY15 and FY16 revenue increases 3% and 6%, and EPS increases 4% and 8% as iPhone carries above-average gross margins and Watch margins improve over time. We leave our price target unchanged at $166 despite CY15 EPS increasing by 6% to $9.73 as we lower the base case multiple from 18x to 17x, which is roughly in-line with the market. We continue to believe Apple deserves a re-rating longer-term to 18-19x as investors come to see it as the world's most valuable platform company. However, it may take time as the company proves Watch success and iPhone customer loyalty can drive long-term revenue and earnings growth. Our bull case of $195 (up from $190) maintains its 19x P/E, which reflects a platform company multiple, while EPS increases slightly to $10.25. 7    2"

Price Performance 140 ï‚· Attractive Tax Structure: Because of differences between US and Irish tax laws and successful tax negotiations between Apple and Ireland, we believe Apple pays                           120 $ negligible tax on ~59% of its global income.

We see even this as largely irrelevant for Apple's share price given the company's large cash pile. ï‚· Worst Case EPS Impact: Using a detailed analysis of Apple's public disclosure and public EC and US documents we estimate that ~59% or $42bn of Apple's EBT runs through the Irish structure with almost no tax. Increasing that tax rate to 12.5% would reduce annual earnings by just under 10% - again in a worst case scenario. ï‚· Remain Overweight Apple. In spite of this potential bump in the road we remain bullish on Apple's stock. We believe that iPhone replacement/share gains, the Apple Watch, a new Apple TV and possibly iAnywhere collectively represent better earnings growth potential than consensus forecasts. Apple Inc.

This is effectively accomplished via AOI or Apple Operations International which is an un-taxed entity. AOI has this special status because of a peculiarity in Irish tax law (some say there by design) which only taxes entities based on where management control resides. The structure is more complex than this with multiple other Irish entities involved including Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE). The US Senate Permanent Subcomittee on Investigations questioned Apple on its tax structure back in May of 2013 and much of the information we have on the structure comes from documents associated with this as well as the European Commission investigation â€“ which we believe may have been prompted by the US investigation. In this section we lay out the structure to help you better understand how Apple is shielding most of their international profits from taxation. Apple Inc Apple Inc. is the US taxpaying entity responsible for coordinating sales in the Americas and Appleâ€™s Irish subsidiaries. Apple Inc. conducts its offshore operations through a network of offshore affiliates. The key affiliates at the top of the offshore network are companies that are incorporated in Ireland. Apple Inc. owns the legal and economic rights to all Intellectual Property (IP) developed by Apple employees worldwide. Apple Inc. also has a cost sharing agreement with two of its Irish entities, ASI and AOE. The cost sharing agreement allows Apple Inc to allocate R&D costs to these entities in proportion to international revenue generated at each entity. For example, in FY11, Apple generated ~60% of its sales outside the Americas. As a result these Irish entities share ~60% of R&D costs with Apple Inc. While this agreement has the effect of increasing Apple Inc profits and associated taxes it also allows the international subsidiaries to sell products and retain profits from these sales overseas without paying US taxes on them. Overview of Key Irish Subsidiaries and Org Structure Apple Operations International is incorporated in Ireland, but is non-tax resident in the country. Ireland allows for incorporated entities to be treated as non-tax resident if most of their operations are controlled by management sitting outside Ireland. According to US laws, an entity is non-taxable if it is incorporated outside the US. This difference in laws between the US and Ireland defining taxable entities has allowed Apple to set up AOI as a non-taxable entity for both the US and Ireland even though it has links to both countries. According to documents provided during the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing (US PSI report), Apple Inc owns 100% of AOI, either directly or indirectly through other controlled foreign corporations. AOI, incorporated in Ireland in 1980, is the ultimate owner of most of Appleâ€™s other offshore entities. 2 22 Rod Hall, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-415) 315-6713          07 May 2015 rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com From 2009 to 2012, AOI received $29.9bn in dividends from lower-tiered offshore affiliates, AOE and ASI. According to Apple, AOIâ€™s net income made up 30% of Appleâ€™s total worldwide net profits from 2009-2011. AOI is the parent company of AOE, a subsidiary incorporated in Ireland. AOE is, in turn, the parent company of ASI, another subsidiary incorporated in Ireland again. AOE and ASI only pay Irish tax on business carried out in Ireland. While there are other subsidiaries in Ireland, AOE and ASI are the two key entities that we believe are important for understanding Appleâ€™s international tax structure. Figure 1: Apple: Offshore Organizational Structure Source: US Senate Permanent Subcommittee On Investigations report. AOE According to relevant public documents published by the European Commission, AOE is a 100% subsidiary of AOI and is an Irish incorporated non-tax resident company carrying on a trade through a branch in Ireland. The main activity of AOEâ€™s Irish branch is the manufacture of Apple products based on disclosures in EC documents. AOE theoretically purchases materials from related companies and sells manufactured products to other related companies. AOEâ€™s Irish branch also provides shared services to Apple companies in EMEA, including payroll services, centralized purchasing and a customer call center. AOE is party to a cost sharing agreement whereby, together with other Apple Inc. subsidiaries, it shares R&D costs and risks of developing certain Apple products. Apple Inc holds the legal title to all Apple IP, while AOE has subsidiary economic IP rights under this cost sharing agreement. 3 23"

As consumer awareness grows through 1) broader merchant acceptance of Apple Pay, and 2) higher competition from Samsung Pay and Google Wallet, we expect Apple and Samsung to benefit the most from higher penetration of their premium mobile devices capable of mobile payments. Apple Pay is Killer App for Apple Watch. We think the convenience of using Apple Pay on Apple Watch with or without a tethered iPhone, while ensuring a higher level of security and privacy as compared to using physical credit cards, is likely to gain traction as a smarter way to pay. ""Apple Pay 2.0"" with browser-based payments and loyalty card support, as described by Jason Kupferberg (see our mobile payments franchise note linked below), would further increase the relevance and persistence of Apple Pay. By the end of 2016, we estimate that roughly 90% of the global iPhone installed base would be Apple Pay (NFC) capable (see Chart 1). We expect Apple Watch penetration to also steadily increase over that period, in some cases as an accessory to an older iPhone 5/5s/5c. More broadly speaking, we expect Apple Watch to become a convenient and secure repository of electronic credentials not just for mobile payments, but also for identity/authentication across a variety of usage scenarios - e.g. airline boarding passes, membership cards, hotel room key, or even Enterprise access. Expect Competition from Samsung Pay in 2H15. On its 1Q15 earnings call Samsung described Samsung Pay as ""triple secured"" through 1) fingerprint, 2) secure element, and 3) Samsung KNOX. Samsung plans to roll out Samsung Pay in Korea and the U.S. in 2H15. We also expect future Samsung Smartwatches to integrate Samsung Pay. Since Samsung Pay integrates both NFC-based, and conventional magstripe-based payment technologies, we think it could potentially see broader adoption than Apple Pay (NFC only), and accelerate consumer awareness of mobile payments. Expect Virtuous Cycle of Mobile Payments to Benefit Apple and Samsung. We think direct contribution from Apple Pay is unlikely to be an EPS needle mover for Apple. Instead, we think the convenience of Apple Pay would drive increased adoption of iPhone and Apple Watch. We expect Apple Pay and Samsung Pay to serve as unique differentiators that other Smartphone/Watch makers would find difficult to match. Links to Related Reports.

Cirrus guided June quarter revenue +77% Y/Y and +6% Q/Q at the mid-point, compared to our iPhone and iPad forecast of +14% Y/Y and -25% Q/Q (Exhibit 3). Excluding some revenue from the Wolfson acquisition in August 2014, the trendline still suggests upside to our iPhone estimate of 46M for the June quarter, assuming little iPad upside to our 9.5M estimate. Similarly, Multi-Fineline Electronix, with 68% revenue exposure to Apple in the last three quarters, guided June quarter revenue flat Q/Q. Lower warranty accruals contributed to gross margin upside in the March quarter. Warranty accruals as a % of revenue fell from 2.8% in the December quarter to 1.7% in the March quarter, boosting gross margin by 110 Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with bps all else equal (Exhibit 4). While this metric may still decline Q/Q in the June    companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, quarter, we do not expect a gross margin tailwind of this magnitude.

Investors should consider Morgan quarter, offsetting a 40 bps headwind from FX, lower iPhone mix, and lower             Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their than corporate average Watch margins in the launch quarter.                            investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, Apple made two new legal disclosures in the 10-Q. First, it noted that the             refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this European Commission (EC) initiated a formal investigation in June 2014                 report. 94 1 Apple, Inc. | April 30, 2015 against Ireland for alleged state aid to Apple. Apple believes the assertions are without merit, but if the EC were to conclude against Ireland, Apple may need to pay up to 10 years of past taxes, which the company did not quantify. We don't believe Apple's tax rate benefit is different from other companies and therefore view a large settlement as unlikely. However, new legislation could put upward pressure on go forward tax rates for Apple and many of its peers. Second, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas awarded Smartflash $533M in its case against Apple. However, Apple is challenging the verdict and has not recorded a loss accrual. 95 2 Apple, Inc. | April 30, 2015 Risk Reward World's Most Valuable Technology Platform Enhanced by New Devices and Services Investment Thesis Apple has the world's most valuable technology platform, and we believe is best positioned to capture more of their users' time in areas such as health, cars and homes, as these platforms expand in the Internet of Things computing era.

Price Performance ï‚· iPhone momentum strong: We believe that global demand for the iPhone 6 and 6                               140 Plus remains strong with above seasonal demand in weaker macro countries like                              120 China. We are forecasting 53.8m iPhone shipments in FQ2 and 47.5m in FQ3.                              $ 100 ï‚· ASR increase expected: We are modeling for Apple to expand its capital return                               80 program to $155bn from $130bn and extend the target date of completion of the                                    Apr-14     Jul-14   Oct-14   Jan-15    Apr-15 program to Dec-16 from Dec-15.                                                                                               AAPL share price ($) S&P500 (rebased) ï‚· Apple Watch focus: We expect a lot of focus on the call on Apple Watch                                                    YTD        1m            3m            12m Abs            18.0%      2.8%          15.2%         60.6% shipments/pre-order numbers and the supply situation.

However, we arenâ€™t sure just how much data Apple will provide on the Watch given it will be lumped into the Other reporting category. ï‚· iPad shipments: We expect another weak iPad quarter from Apple. We are forecasting 14.7m iPad shipments in FQ2 and 12.6m in FQ3. ï‚· FQ2â€™15 Estimates/Guidance/Consensus: For FQ2â€™15, we are forecasting total revenue of $54.46bn (cons: $55.96bn, Guid: $52bn-$55bn), gross margin of 39.3% (cons: 39.5%, guid: 38.5%-39.5%), opex of $5.49bn (cons: $5.46bn, guid: $5.4bn- $5.5bn), EBIT margin of 29.2% (cons: 29.7%) and EPS of $2.06 (cons: $2.16). ï‚· FQ3â€™15 Estimates/Consensus: For FQ3â€™15, we are forecasting total revenue of $47.69bn (cons: $46.93bn), gross margin of 39.0% (cons: 38.9%), opex of $5.37m (cons: $5.49m), EBIT margin of 27.5% (cons: 27.2%) and EPS of $1.71 (cons: $1.68).

Significant increases to cash return program were roughly in line with expectations, and plans to use                              Financial Summary debt to fund cash returns were consistent with our analysis of U.S. cash flow.                               Net Debt (MM):                                ($149.7) While we believe Apple is executing well, we think investors could struggle to interpret iPhone and Watch gross margins near term.

Daily Vol.:               53,566,600 for Watch. We believe investors were expecting Watch gross margins to be significantly higher than corporate avg. We believe iPhone growth would continue to be driven by China, but with a mix skewed toward iPhone 6 rather than 6+, or toward lower storage capacities (16GB/64GB vs. 128GB), iPhone gross margins could be lighter than investors expect. We Could Become More Constructive on the stock with evidence of faster than expected growth in Watch, iPad (see our Enterprise iPad note linked below) or Cloud Services, or lower investor expectations. We are concerned investors might be dismissing competitive threat from Samsung Galaxy S6/Edge.

We like the changes Apple is making to iPad for Enterprise,                                Financial Summary and expect more changes to come this year. But Android (Samsung KNOX) and                                    Net Debt (MM):                         ($141,552.0) Windows (Surface 3) are also advancing, and we expect higher competition in Enterprise client devices. We like the Apple Watch.                                                          Market Data 52 Week Range:            $133.60 - $80.10 iPad is Changing For Enterprise. We think a combination of IBM MobileFirst for iOS, iOS extensions, and availability of Microsoft Office for iOS are increasing the relevance of iPad                Total Entprs. Value (MM):      $624,728.9 for broader Enterprise applications, even though iOS continues to limit file system access                   Market Cap. (MM):              $766,280.9 (Charts 2-to-10). However, with KNOX, we believe Samsung has closed the Android security                     Insider Ownership:                   0.7% gap with iOS (Charts 16, 17), and with Surface 3, Wintel is fortifying its enterprise dominance              Institutional Ownership:            73.3% through a highly capable and affordable device that the iPad could find difficult to beat near Shares Out. (MM):                  5,881.8 term (Chart 12). We expect the iPad to mimic larger display, integrated stylus, and USB 3.0 offerings from competition, potentially starting in 2H15.

Daily Vol.:               53,597,380 Apple Watch: Mobile Payments Killer App. In addition to health/fitness tracking, which we think could potentially grow into a large new ""Enterprise"" market for Apple over time, we think consumers and investors are probably under-appreciating the fact that mobile payments through Apple Pay (or Samsung Pay) would be more secure than payments made using physical credit cards. The security/privacy benefit could drive higher penetration of both mobile payments and Smartwatches globally. We are testing the Apple Watch and expect to provide an update on its capabilities and a comparison with our Samsung Gear S, which we have been using for ~6 months.

New iPad apps developed in collaboration with IBM increase iPad's relevance in vertical applications such as financial markets, utilities, government, healthcare, industrial, insurance, retail, telco, and travel, consistent with our expectations (see prior note linked here: Enterprise Ecosystem Progress â€“ Maintain Hold). We think the largest such untapped opportunity probably lies within the healthcare industry, which when combined with the health-monitoring capabilities built into the Apple Watch, we think represents a major new potential market for Apple (IBM has estimated global healthcare spending in the $7 trillion range) longer term. Additionally, with enhancements such as iOS Extensions (see Chart 13), we believe Apple is trying to make the iPad more relevant in a traditional Enterprise environment, as an alternative to Wintel PCs. This is an area where the iPad has not seen impressive penetration, except as an optional/additional device incapable of replacing a primary Enterprise PC. We think availability of Microsoft Office for iPad also dramatically increases the Enterprise utility of iPad (see our case study in Charts 19 to 23). Meanwhile, introduction of Microsoftâ€™s Surface 3 at the $499 price point represents a big step forward by Wintel, in closing the price gap relative to iPad, while delivering superior Enterprise capabilities. Also, Samsungâ€™s KNOX closes Android security gaps to deliver a robust and secure Enterprise solution, building on flexibility inherent in Android.

Over the past nine quarters, Apple beat the high end of revenue guidance by low single-digit percentages and GM by roughly 30bps, excluding the more significant beat in C4Q14. June quarter revenue guidance likely slightly below consensus, similar to past quarters. Supply chain builds suggest 45M iPhones (vs. our 43M) and 9.5M iPads (in-line with our model), and we model 3M Watches in the June quarter. These numbers imply revenue just over $46B, which is 1.5% below consensus closer to $47B. The midpoint of Apple's revenue guidance range has been below consensus in seven out of the last nine quarters, or 4% on average. In contrast, the midpoint of gross margin guidance has been in-line to Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with slightly ahead of consensus in recent quarters and we see potential for a          companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Given the strength of the US Dollar, Apple raised prices of its products, including iPhones and Macs, in Europe, Canada, and a few other countries in early March. Though this helps offset the translation risk, the demand impact is less clear. We expect a new cash return program in the $130B to $150B range over a three-year period. We model $90B of share buybacks and $39B of dividends for a total return of $129B from FY16 to FY18. Since the current program started 2.5 years ago, Apple returned 100% of its free cash flow on a fully taxed basis. We believe the company will continue with a similar strategy, which implies potential upside to our model to the $150B range. We see multiple upcoming catalysts and remain Overweight with 24% upside to our $160 PT. News reports suggest Apple could announce new services at its upcoming developer conference starting June 8, including a streaming music service and/or a new Apple TV set-top box with cable and broadcast TV content packages, an App Store, and/or HomeKit (allowing for integration with third-party smart home appliances). We believe Apple could also announce new partnerships relating to HealthKit, ResearchKit, Carplay, or Apple Pay. In our Bull Case, we expect the Services business to approach 20% of Apple's total EBIT by CY17, which in addition to Watch diversifying Apple's product exposure, can help drive a re-rating in the stock from 15x P/E today up to 18-19x where platform peers are trading. While investors worry about the potential for iPhone unit declines next year, we see continued support from installed base upgrades (Exhibit 2) helping maintain at least flattish iPhone units in 2016. Our $160 PT assumes an 18x P/E, in-line with other technology platform stories. 3002"

Watch Apple Change Computing, Again Our last report, â€œHow to Think About the Watchâ€ (link), garnered a lot of questions around our belief that the Watch will act as the â€œdigital conciergeâ€ of oneâ€™s devices. The most common question wasâ€“what does â€œconcierge of devicesâ€ mean? This report attempts to answer that question and present our theory of everythingâ€¦Apple. Key Points ï‚·    Software/Internet Services-Harbingers of a Paradigm Shift: On the software and internet services side of things, decentralization happened much earlier than hardware. The advent of the smartphone and apps enabled consumers to customize their own computing experience so that it could be drastically different from the next personâ€™s. Whereas in hardware, device convergence is still ongoing and signs of higher level customization and divergence are only beginning to surface. See Exhibit 5. ï‚·    The Monopoly of Smartphone: In the more mature stage of TV and desktop PC, they evolved to be connected with many peripheral hardware pieces (think home theater in the case of TV, or MP3 players, digital camera, and PDA in the case of PC)â€”a form of decentralization. Todayâ€™s smartphone does everything by itself, but we think that model will change soon as consumers begin adopting IoT devices. ï‚·    Dethroning the Smartphone: The mobile computing experience, on the hardware level, is not as customized as on the software level. In our view, several factors contribute to this: access to funds for hardware start-ups, economies of scale, and the need for a unifying interface. With many of those barriers removed over the past few years, we still have not seen a strong uptick in hardware. The one thing missing is the interfaceâ€”we have it now: the Watch. We believe the Apple Watch will lead consumers into an age of decentralized hardware in the next five years. The Watch will usher in the next age of computing. Bottom Line: For the watch to be a success, it will, over time, have to change user behavior for the next phase of computingâ€”not only mobile (current generation), but also ubiquitous (next generation). We have gone from spending hours on a PC to spending minutes on smartphonesâ€“in the next stage of human-computer interaction, we believe users will be spending seconds instead of minutes or hours dealing with electronic devices. This will be facilitated by a notification-based interface on the Watch. 2 353 Apple Inc. â€œStrangely Familiarâ€ Rarely does the general public get Apple products right at first sight, before their actual shipment. Looking back at Appleâ€™s first generation product launches (iPod, iPhone, and iPad), one thing becomes clear: each product begged the question: what does it do? Below are some reviews/quotes that followed the product announcements. First iPod (announced in October 2001): â€œClearly Apple is following Sony's lead by integrating consumer electronics devices into its marketing strategy, but Apple lacks the richness of Sony's product offering. And introducing new consumer products right now is risky, especially if they cannot be priced attractivelyâ€¦â€ (Technology Business Research, October 2001) First iPhone (announced in January 2007): â€œThe keyboard more or less requires ""faith"" in the word auto-correction, an Apple rep likened it to using The Force, and while all three reviewers were able to get up to speed sooner or later, it's most certainly agreed that this is no BlackBerry- killer.â€ (Engadget, review of other journalistâ€™s iPhone reviews, June 2007) â€œFive hundred dollars? Fully subsidized? With a plan? That is the most expensive phone in the world. And it doesnâ€™t appeal to business customers because it doesnâ€™t have a keyboard, which makes it not a very good email machine.â€ (Steve Ballmer, 2007) First iPad (announced in January 2010): â€This time around the Next Big Thing is called an iPad. It's basically an oversize iPod Touchâ€¦ Jobs and his team kept using words like â€œbreakthroughâ€ and â€œmagicalâ€, but the iPad is neither, at least not right nowâ€¦At the very least, we had hoped a tablet from Apple would do something new, something we've never seen before. That's not the caseâ€¦â€ (Newsweek, January 2010) Not that we think we get it right all the timeâ€”but in this report, we attempt to at least â€œthink differentâ€. We believe all products are built to solve problems, some obvious, some less so. When a problem is less obvious, designers need to ask the right questions and correctly frame the problem, then find a solution. The reason opinions are divided on the Watch, is that it solves both existing problems (time-keeping, fitness tracking) and problems we donâ€™t know exist (new ways to connect to people and potentially to other devices). Itâ€™s this second question that Apple tends to get right, and early reviews tend not to answer. Current smart watch products, mostly miniature smartphones in disguise, educate consumers poorly on new possibilities. We find it interesting that Apple never uses adjectives like â€œsmartâ€, or â€œintelligentâ€ to describe the Watch. We believe this is a carefully considered choice made by Apple, because, contrary to smartphones, computing-related problems are not priorities for the Watch. What we believe Apple does best is improving the human interface for electronic devices (mouse for Mac, Touch Pad for MacBook, Click Wheel for iPod, and multi-touch for iPhone). When a product is launched consumers, bloggers, analysts, and journalists tend to compare it to familiar, existing products (iPod vs. MP3 player; iPhone vs. Blackberry). What we learn in retrospect is that the actual products are anything but. This is because the new interface introduces new possibilities that escape the imagination of the general 3 354"

Expect Progress in Cloud Services. We have shown (see Cloud Services franchise note linked below) that Google is leading Apple by a wide margin in Cloud Services. With iPhone growth coming from China, we think there is risk that iTunes/other non-hardware revenues grow at a slower pace (Chart 7), given dominance of domestic Cloud Services in China. We continue to expect Apple's investments in services (including potentially ""Web TV Services"") to increase, and would view such progress favorably.

Data through the end of February                       Apple, Inc. ( AAPL.O , AAPL US ) IT Hardware / United States of America indicates March quarter iPhone demand is tracking to 55M units.

Our                   Shr price, close (Mar 10, 2015)                             $124.51 tracker indicates 55M unit demand for the March quarter, similar to sell-side     Mkt cap, curr (mm)                                        $729,621 consensus and just above our model of 54M. Our Asia tech analyst Jasmine Lu       52-Week Range                                         $133.60-73.05 expects iPhone builds to be â€œslightly higherâ€ than 52M. We believe Apple could report some upside vs. our tracker as it has to fill the channel with about two weeks of inventory to reach the mid-point of its 5-7 week target. That would add an additional 7M units on top of end demand over the next few quarters. At most, we expect less than a week of channel inventory build in the March quarter, equating to around 2M units. Other recent data points suggest iPhone demand is robust, though hard to quantify precisely. At the Spring Forward keynote on March 9, 2015, CEO Tim Cook revealed Apple has shipped 700M cumulative iPhones. The company shipped 665M at the end of the December quarter, and a quarter-to-date number - assuming linear demand and 54M total units in the March quarter - would be 707M. Given Apple tends to report round numbers, we believe 700M suggests the quarter is on track. Separately, AT&T released an 8-K on March 10, 2015 saying it â€œexpects continued expansion of its high-value smartphone base,â€ which we believe suggests good iPhone demand in the US. Our AlphaWise survey published in January indicated 51% of AT&T's postpaid subscriber base had iPhones, higher than the other Big 4 US carriers at 17- 36%. AT&T also noted postpaid upgrades were â€œsolid.â€ This is consistent with our survey, which suggested a higher portion of iPhone users were planning to upgrade this quarter vs. users of other smartphones. China driving iPhone growth in the quarter, according to our tracker. By region, China and Brazil are growing the fastest Y/Y. US, UK, Germany and France are seeing similar growth but slower than the emerging markets. Japan is the clear laggard. We attribute China's faster growth to (1) iPhone 6 and 6     Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with Plus launching on October 17, 2014, about a month after the first wave of          companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Showcased apps included tests for asthma and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Apple Watch As detailed in our report 5-Jan-15 report â€œWatch the Watch in 2015,â€ we see two of the biggest hurdles for smartwatches as their 1) small usable size and 2) questionable fashion style, but believe these two vectors are exactly where we think Apple most shines â€“ with proven ability to develop intuitive software UIs and design tech products that are as fashionable as they are functional. We think focusing on smartwatch specs misses this â€œfashion intangible,â€ likely the most important factor in ultimate adoption, yet we see Apple as the one company that could make smartwatches cool. A third hurdle we see is limited battery life and there even Apple cannot bypass the laws of chemistry, but that is expressly why we believe it architected the Watch as an iPhone accessory vs. standalone product, offloading all heavy-lifting to its paired iPhone. Apple Watch battery life, expected to last about a day, has now been specified as 18 hours. Figure 1.

We think this is the first time since the iPod, that Apple might have introduced a new product category without dramatically raising the technology or capability bar over competition, particularly from Samsung. We expect Apple Pay, and fitness/health tracking to serve as the killer applications. Expect Health/Fitness Tracking to Become a Killer App. Over the last few months of continuously using the Samsung Gear S Smartwatch, we have found its pedometer, heart-rate sensor, and location/distance/elevation measurements to be particularly useful in generating high resolution exercise/activity tracking data, which we think could be further enhanced with measurements for other types of health data, including blood pressure, blood glucose, etc. to provide a more complete picture of one's health/fitness. With integrated standalone communications capabilities as in the Samsung Gear S, we foresee a higher level of consumer interest in fitness/health applications in the future, including the capability to communicate seamlessly and securely with qualified medical and fitness industry professionals, who would be armed with vital data from the Smartwatch to enable more frequent and tailored guidance. Fashion Forward: Possible upside to Apple Watch ASP. We believe our Apple Watch ASP estimate of $400 is approximately in line with the Street's; however, given the $549 starting price for the standard stainless steel version of the Apple Watch, and materially higher-priced lifestyle/fashion-focused offerings, we think there could be upside to our Apple Watch ASPs. We continue to model Apple Watch shipments of ~16m units in FY15 (vs. Street range of 8m to 41m, and Fubon 15m). Pre-orders and previews (at Apple Stores) for the Apple Watch are expected to begin on April 10th and the Watch is expected to become available starting April 24th in 9 countries (including China). Our checks indicate difficulties with the casing and display might be causing delays. Our build plan checks also indicate a significant skew toward lower-end models.

With the exception of Apple Pay, which would be unique to the Apple Watch until Samsung integrates Samsung Pay in upcoming updates to its Smartwatches, virtually all of the other capabilities that Apple showed off seemed to be on par with those from competing devices, including the Samsung Gear S (see our Samsung note linked below), and a range of similarly or lower-priced Android Wear powered Smartwatches. Given limited compute, storage, and communications capabilities provided within the Watch itself, we expect Cloud Services to increasingly become the battleground for discovering, collecting, organizing, and delivering the most relevant and                                                 Sundeep Bajikar * Equity Analyst timely information to the Watch - see our Cloud Services note linked below.

As we expected, Watch distribution - in 9 countries through Apple retail stores and select high-end resellers - is limited so that Apple can better educate consumers on the new user interface. Watch pricing suggests likely ASP and margin upside. Apple announced the full range of price points: $349-399 for the aluminum Watch Sport, $549- 1,099 for the stainless steel Watch, and $10,000-17,000 for the gold Watch Edition. If Apple achieves 1% penetration of the 30M-unit a year Swiss luxury watch market with the high-end gold collection, and the rest of the Watch units are split between the entry and mid-range collections, Apple's Watch ASP in the first 12 months would be $618, or 37% higher than our $450 estimate. In turn, gross margin should also come in higher than our 45% estimate. Event revealed some incremental positives for the Watch. CEO Tim Cook better articulated the purpose of the Watch, positioning it as (1) accurate and customizable timepiece, (2) intimate communications device, and (3) health and fitness tracker. These use cases are supplemented by other â€œbrief interactions,â€ such as Apple Pay or â€œglancesâ€ at third-party apps. Management showcased apps from Facebook, Twitter, Uber, American Airlines, SPG, ESPN, etc., and said developers have already created thousands of new apps since the software development kit launched last November. Apple said the Watch has an all-day, 18-hour battery life, which addresses the main concern following the first Watch event in September.

Itâ€™s interior decorating. Itâ€™s the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.â€ -Steve Jobs, CNNMoney/Fortune, January 24, 2000 In this note, we focus on the upcoming Apple Watch (â€œthe Watchâ€ hereinafter) and explain our understanding and expectation for its differentiation, positioning, competitive advantage, and its role in the entire Apple ecosystem. We are very optimistic on the Watchâ€™s long-term market potential and see it as an object of utility, affection, and luxury that represents the next step in our â€œmobile firstâ€ future. We also raise our price target and financial estimates for Apple based on more bullish outlook on its product cycle. Key Points ï‚·    Better Interface Always Wins: We believe superior understanding and expertise of human interface designs are Appleâ€™s core competency. While Apple is shackled by the same limitation of battery power and chip speed, human interface innovations on the Watch will make it fundamentally more feature-rich, user-friendly, and elegant than the competition. ï‚·    The Watch Has Three Roles: We believe the Watch will take three roles: an object of utility, affection, and luxury. The Watch is first an efficient extension of the smartphone, second, a facilitator of intimate personal communications, and lastly a high margin product that provides substantial revenue and margin upside to AAPL. ï‚· th March 9th Event Preview: We expect Appleâ€™s March 9 press event to be centered around the Watch, from which we expect details on apps, new features, hardware, sales strategies, and shipment timing. We also expect Apple to release a refreshed MacBook Air and Apple TV. Lastly, we believe a music streaming service merging iTunes Radio and Beats Music will come online sometime in 1H15 (also possible at WWDC in June). ï‚·    Model Update: We raise our price target from $130 to $155. Our revised estimates are driven by higher revenue contribution from iPhone and the Watch, margin improvement from better mix, and strong FY16 outlook in emerging markets. The long-term price target of $155 is based on 13 times FY16 EPS of $9.76 plus $25 per share net cash. We believe our estimates are conservative. ï‚·    Risks to Our Thesis: Key risks to our thesis include lower than expected iPhone shipment in FY16 (successor to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus), lower than expected margin and Apple Watch shipment, unexpected margin pressure from material cost and FX volatility, higher than expected spending in operations, and lower than expected growth in China. 2 586 Apple Inc. Human Interface above All Human interface is at the center of all Apple products: we think of Apple as a human- centric, technology product development company. As we explained in our first report on Apple in September (link), Apple, like no other consumer electronics makers, has always set human interface as one of the highest priorities in its product development. Almost all of its â€œrock starâ€ products are associated with major breakthroughs in human interface features. Apple Watch is no exception to this rule. When the Watch was introduced in September 2014, we saw what we expected, and much more. Apple Watch brings new human interface designs and user experience features that achieve two important goals: 1) expanding the physical limitation of hardware; and 2) bringing more â€œhuman touchâ€ to a device that interact with users more intimately. Good human interface design provide a better user experience and makes more efficient use of hardware resources (display size and CPU power). This is especially important as devices gets smaller with more constrained resources and more personal touches. Also, as devices becomes more personal with users, the interface is required to deliver more â€œaffectionâ€ more â€œfunctionsâ€.

Inc. The Watch vs. Competition Just like the iPhone, the Watch looks less impressive on the spec sheet alongside its competitors. Its hardware seems little differentiated (and potentially underpowered) comparing to competing products on the market today. But we believe the key for Apple Watchâ€™s potential success lies in its multiple human interface innovations and new Watch OS. 3 587 Apple Inc.

Inc. If the success of Pebble and more recently, Pebble Time, has taught us anything, it is that spec is almost irrelevant for smart watches. Pure pursuit of performance is bound to end badly with serious compromised battery life. The small size determined that OEMs have to think harder for the most compelling use cases and make difficult compromises balancing performance and user experience. In fact, we can see this in the adoption of android smart watches or lack thereof. Pebble adopts a differentiated customer centric approach. We believe Pebble alone (including orders for Pebble Time) has outsold all other Android Wear based products combined. We see little innovation in smart watches running Android Wear. The operating system is essentially a miniaturized smartphone interface, with inefficient use of display (round watch face) and poor readability. However, Apple Watch breaks the physical limitation of a watch to various degrees by introducing new ways for users to interact with the devices.

While the largest opportunities - TV and Autos - are further out, we see Apple expanding its total addressable market (TAM) near-term with Watch and Services, like Apple Pay and streaming music. In total, we see a $3.4T TAM by 2020, up from just under $1B today.

Apple Is a Platform Company It offers the best devices at what it considers a fair price. The company focuses on providing users a superior experience through well-integrated and innovative hardware, software, services, and ecosystem. As a result, its users are the most loyal, and they tend to purchase multiple Apple devices. This is best reflected in the iPhone, where the company has kept pricing steady in the last few years even as competitors had to half their pricing to compete. Services to see revenue growth inflection and margin expansion in CY15, due to Apple Pay, App Store and iCloud. We believe Apple Pay can grow from 1% of Services revenue in CY15 to 14% in CY17, with 100% incremental operating margins. Services should become even more important in the future, both as a platform differentiator and revenue and profitability generator. We see many future opportunities, especially in streaming music, HealthKit, HomeKit and CarPlay. And increasingly, Apple may control less of the hardware and focus more on software and services. Developers and merchants generate at least 2x as much revenue on iOS vs. Android, even though Android ships more units, due to better iOS user demographics and easier-to-use devices. With multiple new partnership opportunities in media content (iTunes, Beats, Apple TV), health, home, cars, etc., we believe this will continue to strengthen Apple's platform. Devices Apple users are loyal as 89% of iPhone users plan to buy another iPhone. We believe Apple's device installed base, including 415M+ iPhone users, is much stickier than some investors realize. Our latest survey in the US, Apple's largest market, indicated 89% of current iPhone users plan to buy another iPhone. In China, Apple's second largest market, 75% of iPhone users plan to buy another iPhone, and loyalty increased significantly from 60% about a year ago. We believe loyalty increases for the market leaders as the market matures, as evidenced by the US data. Users gain familiarity with one ecosystem over time, and get locked in as they store, synchronize and share more data on the platform and purchase more devices (â€œhalo effectâ€), apps and media. 4 621 Apple, Inc. | March 2, 2015 Exhibit 1: Apple Has the Most Loyal Customers in the US (Measured as % of Current Users Who Plan to Purchase Another Phone from the Same Brand) So u rce: Alp h aW ise Su rvey Decemb er 2014, Mo rgan Stan ley Research Exhibit 2: Apple Brand Loyalty in China Also Market-Leading and Growing So u rce: Alp h aW ise Su rvey Au gu st 2014, Mo rgan Stan ley Research Apple's customers are willing to pay a premium for better user experience. Apple's products are known for their ease-of-use, expansive ecosystem, and security and privacy. The company provides high-quality retail and support services. Customers are willing to pay for such an experience, and they have voted with their wallets. We believe Apple's profit share in the smartphone market will pass 80% in CY15, more than double its revenue share of 36% and 2.5x its unit share of 14%. Apple's profit share is increasing, from about 75% in CY14 5 622 Apple, Inc. | March 2, 2015 and 60% in CY13, mainly because Samsung is lowering its average selling price to defend its market share. We estimate all other smartphone brands outside of Apple and Samsung will roughly breakeven this year. Exhibit 3: Apple Dominates Smartphone Profits by Focusing on Users Who Value a Superior Experience So u rce: IDC, Co mp an y Data, Mo rgan Stan ley Research iPhone ASP has been stable in the last 6+ years vs. Android declining by 50%+. iPhone ASP declined only 1% a year from FY10, which was the iPhone 3GS cycle, through FY14, the 5s and 5c cycle. In FY15, we expect ASP to increase 8% in the 6 and 6 Plus cycle as buyers choose higher capacity options and/or the larger screen 6 Plus, which is $100 more than the 6. The majority of competitors use Android, limiting their product differentiation, and often resort to price competition to gain share. Compared to Apple, competitors do not possess the combination of hardware and software integration and innovation, for example the fingerprint sensor, and new proprietary services, for example Apple Pay and iCloud. 6 623"

Using our detailed iPhone user base model we calculate the base of users who would be eligible to use an Apple Watch in each quarter post launch. We estimate that this base will be ~400m at the end of Marchâ€™15 growing to 525m by the end of December of 2015. In our central case, assuming 5% penetration by YEâ€™15 and 13% penetration by YE16, we estimate that Apple would ship 26m watches in 2015 and 55m in 2016. By the end of 2016 our user base model predicts that Apple will have 627m iPhone users with the technology necessary to make use of Apple Watch.

We note that Apple has shipped ~421m iPhones since the launch of iPhone 5. We estimate further shipments of ~230m iPhones in CY15 and 252m iPhones in CY16. Figure 1 below illustrates the output from our user base model for iPhone 5and above over time. As we indicated earlier this base grows to an astounding 627m users by the end of 2016 in our model.

Morgan estimates. We estimate the total iPhone installed base to be 536m at the end of CYâ€™14, up from 444m as of the end of Jun-2014.

Of the total 536m user installed base, we estimate that 377m or 70% units were Apple Watch compatible devices as of the end of CYâ€™14 moving to ~400m by the end of Marchâ€™15. Our estimate of 70% compares well with Appleâ€™s own estimate of 72% iOS 8 devices in its base. Note that, as of Jun 2014, Apple had sold 800m iOS devices, including 200m iPads, 100m iPod touches and >500m iPhones. Apple Watch Adoption Scenarios We have developed three scenarios for Apple Watch adoption in order to give readers some idea of the sensitivity of our earnings model to different potential outcomes. We have selected a central case which includes addressable base penetration of 5% by the end of 2015 moving to 13% by the end of CYâ€™16. However, we are still missing key features of the device like battery life that could impact the speed of adoption. The inclusion of this Central case in our forecasts increases our CYâ€™15 EPS forecast by 6% to $9.46 and our CYâ€™16 forecast by 12% to $11.02. As we note below this is based on what we feel is a conservative view that the EBIT contribution margin for the Sport model will be just in line with group average margins. Central Case Penetration Scenario We assume the Apple Watch penetrates 5% of the addressable user base by the end of CY15 moving up to 13% of the addressable base by CY16. This equates to 26m Watch shipments in 2015 and 55m in 2016.

Morgan estimates. In our Central penetration case, we show the impact of variations in margins and mix of watches on our previous CY15 and CY16 EPS estimates. As stated above, our Apple EPS estimate moves by ~6% to $9.46 for CY15 and by ~12% to $11.02 for CY16, assuming most of the watches to be sold will be the Sport version at a base price of $349 with 31% EBIT contribution margin. We discuss our profit margin assumptions below. Margin assumptions by Apple Watch model We lay out our margin assumptions for the Apple Watch in Table 2 below. We begin with our assumptions for the pricing of the Stainless Steel ($1,000) and Gold ($4,000) versions of the Watch. While Apple has announced the $349 price for the 3 676 Rod Hall, CFA             North America Equity Research (1-415) 315-6713          11 February 2015 rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com aluminum Sport model they have not said how they will price higher end models. However, we believe that Apple intends to promote their higher end Watches as luxury products and is, therefore, likely to price them as such. In terms of BoM for the Watch we are using a slightly higher $105 for the Sport model than we believe products like the Samsung Gear Live carry. We make a rough materials cost adjustment for the Stainless (+$95) and Gold (+$695) models. Table 2: Apple Watch Margin Assumptions Sport     Stainless     Gold Starting price                  $350        $1,000    $4,000 BoM                             $105          $200      $800 Assumed Gross Margin            45%           71%       78% Gross Profit per device         $158          $713    $3,113 Implied other device costs     $88           $88       $88 Incremental opex/device          $50           $50       $50 Implied EBIT contribution       $108          $663    $3,063 Implied EBIT Margin             31%           66%       77% Source: J.P. Morgan Our next step is to assume a gross margin contribution for the Sport model of 45%. This is above Apple's current group average GM of ~39% though Implied Other Device costs within GM are notoriously difficult to estimate. Our 45% assumption yields implied other costs within GM of $88/device which we assume are the same regardless of model. We next assume incremental opex of $50/device which yields an EBIT contribution margin for the Sport model of 31% - similar to Appleâ€™s group average margin. We note that this $50/device assumption could prove conservative given it is not obvious where Apple needs to incur significant additional cost to bring the device to market. Due to this we believe the key risk to our analysis is that Apple generates materially more margin than we have assumed in any of our cases. Also note that the EBIT margin contribution from both the Stainless and Gold versions is likely far higher than the Sport version. Later in this report we show how various mix assumption affect Apple earnings but suffice it to say that more of these luxury models in the mix, if we are in the ballpark on pricing, can have a large impact on margin contribution. 4 677"

AAPL has traded at a forward P/E averaging 13x over the past 5 years, within a wide range of 10x-25x. AAPL Risks: We see Apple risks as including its exposure to premium-priced consumer IT markets and revenue/profit concentration from just a handful of key products, particularly its iPhone. Competitive risks include pricing and margin pressure from lower-priced global suppliers. We believe Apple-specific risks also still include its future product strategies/pipeline post the passing of former CEO and visionary, Steve Jobs. 2 751"

Previous: $112.00 Apple blew out our iPhone unit expectations and delivered a 21.6% EPS beat as                           IT Hardware iPhone revenues came in 24% ahead of our forecast. FX held guidance back in FQ2.                                                      AC Rod Hall, CFA We continue to see a significant potential pipeline of new products in 2015 that we                     (1-415) 315-6713 believe will drive earnings growth ahead of peers. We raise our Dec. â€™15 target to                      rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com $140 and reiterate our Overweight rating.                                                               Bloomberg JPMA HALL <GO> J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ï‚· Blowout iPhone units. Apple managed an incredible manufacturing feat by Ashwin Kesireddy shipping 74.468m iPhones in FQ1 representing an 89.6% Q/Q unit increase (1-415) 315-6756 (120.3% Y/Y). We had expected high demand for the iPhone6/6+ but we believed                          ashwin.x.kesireddy@jpmorgan.com manufacturing limits would keep volume in FQ1 near our 64.8m unit forecast.                           J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ï‚· Guidance in line. Revenue guidance of $52bn-$55bn was just 3% above our                               Rajagopal Raghunathan forecast for FQ2. Gross margin guidance of 38.5%-39.5% was a touch better than                        (91-22) 6157-3255 rajagopal.raghunathan@jpmorgan.com our 38.1%. Opex ended up 8% worse at $5.4bn-$5.5bn. All of this added up to J.P. Morgan India Private Limited EBIT almost exactly in line with our model in spite of the large FQ1 beat. We note that, as usual, Appleâ€™s guidance feels conservative to us.                                            Price Performance 120 ï‚· FX headwinds significant in FQ2. CFO Luca Maestri pointed out that Y/Y                                     110 revenue growth would have been 5pp higher in constant currency (CC) and that                               100 $ margins would have been 100bps higher. Adjusting for the FX revenue headwind                                90 80 we calculate that the Q/Q revenue decline would be about 25%, which we see as in 70 line with prior years given the abnormally large iPhone6/6+ success.

Macbook Air unit growth was 37% Y/Y in the quarter, underscoring, we believe, the opportunity for Apple in sub-$1,000 laptops. ï‚· iPad weak. iPad revenues were 16.4% below our forecast at $5.316bn for the quarter. We continue to believe that iAnywhere is likely to reaccelerate iPad unit growth in late 2015 at the partial expense of Macbook Airs. ï‚· Valuation and forecast changes. We increase our FYâ€™15 revenue estimate by 6.5% to $224bn and our EPS forecast moves to $8.99 from $8.06. We increase our Dec.'15 PT to $140 from $112 using a PE based approach. Apple Inc.

Morgan estimates. Consensus from Bloomberg. Positives Incredible iPhone unit volume production ramp Appleâ€™s operating prowess was on full display in FQ1 as the company amazingly managed to ship 74.468m iPhones in FQ1 representing an 89.6% Q/Q unit volume increase and a Y/Y unit increase of 120.3%. We had thought that demand would be exceptionally high for the larger format iPhone6/6+ but we had equally expected manufacturing limits to keep volume shipment in FQ1 closer to our 64.8m unit forecast. We canâ€™t emphasize enough how difficult this kind of one quarter ramp in production volume is nor the execution excellence that Apple just displayed by pulling it off. 2 37"

We continue to think Apple needs to raise its game in Cloud Services to mitigate iOS hardware risk.

FQ1 revenues of $74.6B (Street $67.9B) and EPS of $3.06 (Street $2.61) easily beat Street estimates driven by iPhone 6/6+, and were closer to our EPS of                     Total Entprs.

As iPhone momentum decelerates in 2015, we are concerned Shares Out.

Our analysis (see our Samsung note linked below) suggests Samsung is well positioned to elevate its flagship Smartphones this year using flexible display and 14nm components, with broader use of metal casings to differentiate lower-end phones. Our proprietary survey, Strategy Analytics' user study, and online reviews suggest consumers and carriers are excited about flexible display. In contrast, supply chain expectations for the next iPad and iPhone products from our research partners Fubon in Taiwan appear lackluster. We could become more constructive on AAPL with evidence of progress in Cloud Services, in which we believe Google is leading by a wide margin.

These numbers would beat current consensus revenue, gross margin and EPS estimates by 3%, 1% and 5%, consistent with the last 7 quarters. iPhone and Mac better and iPad weaker than expected in March quarter. iPhone shipments could exceed our 50M C1Q15 estimate, as the supply chain is building over 52M units and we do not believe Apple has reached its targeted channel inventory levels. Recall management plans to increase normal inventory range from 4-6 weeks to 5-7 weeks, and our AlphaWise tracker suggests supply barely outstripped demand in the December quarter. In addition, our latest US consumer survey indicates iPhone ASP could remain strong in the March quarter and beyond so our estimate of -       Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, 5% Q/Q iPhone ASP appears conservative. However, our iPad unit estimate of         investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict 16M could be high as supply chain target is closer to 11M. Mac should offset       of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan iPad somewhat as seasonality implies over 5M Macs in the March quarter vs.         Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their our 4.4M estimate.                                                                 investment decision. For analyst certification and other important disclosures, Apple's March quarter guidance could be below consensus estimates.                 refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this Consensus models revenue of $53.6B, similar to our estimate of $53.2B. Apple       report. 1 114 Apple, Inc. | January 20, 2015 MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH has guided below consensus in six of the last eight quarters by an average of 6% at the mid-point of the guidance range. This would imply a $50B mid-point for this quarter, though we would not be surprised if the range is $3B-wide instead of the $2B historically given uncertainties around the likely launch of a new product category (Watch) and large foreign exchange movements. However, given the upside in iPhones and downside in iPads mentioned above and the new Watch, we could see gross margin guidance bracket consensus of 38.6% or show ~50bps of upside versus December quarter guidance. We model 39.0%. Apple's gross margin guidance at the mid-point has been in-line or slightly better than consensus for the last four quarters. Watch and foreign exchange create some uncertainty. We model 3M Watch shipments in the March quarter, adding $1.4B of revenue. However, Apple management historically embeds conservative assumptions in their guidance for new products, especially products that have yet to launch. Forecasts from Morgan Stanley's FX strategists indicate a 5.7-point Y/Y headwind to Apple's March quarter revenues. While we believe the company will hedge and adjust pricing in some regions (as it has for the App Store in Europe and iPhones in Russia), exchange rates is a bigger headwind than recent quarters. Also note Apple will not report iPod or Watch units going forward as they are part of the Other Products line. We remain Overweight Apple. Key debates in 2015 center around sustainability of iPhone demand, potential impact of Watch, and margin expansion. Our surveys and analyses indicate strong demand for the larger screen iPhones, and a large, aging installed base that will refresh. We believe Watch expectations remain too pessimistic. Our surveys and industry conversations indicate strong interest in wearables, especially Apple's Watch. Net, we see some unit upside vs. consensus iPhone and Watch estimates but especially against conservative gross margin estimates (38.5% in FY15, -10bps Y/Y). We believe growing revenue streams from iPhone, Watch, Beats headphones, Apple Pay all have better than corporate average gross margins, while declining revenue streams from iPad and iPod have lower gross margins. With strong iPhone and Watch unit demand and improving gross margins, we remain Overweight.

Our modeling continues to assume a launch around Mar-15, although Apple has so far only committed to â€œearly 2015â€ which we think could end up Apr-15. Figure 1.

Recognizing size/usage constraints, its Watch OS introduces a new user interface (UI), innovative methods of navigation (e.g., Digital Crown), Force Touch (adding degrees to the touch-screenâ€™s z-axis to differentiate between a light tap vs. deep press; a feature we expect to make its way into future iPads, iPhones), integrates Siri (we expect a smartwatchâ€™s limited real estate only increases the value of voice recognition), Health monitoring sensors and supports Apple Pay. The Apple Watch is expressly designed to pair with a userâ€™s iPhone using onboard Wi-Fi 802.11b/g and Bluetooth 4.0, making it an â€œaccessoryâ€ as the iPhone does most of the heavy- lifting (e.g., processing app code, making calls, etc.). On-board storage and Bluetooth mean the Apple Watch can be used as a standalone music player. Apple Watch will be available in three collections, based on material of enclosure: 1.    Apple Watch = stainless steel w/ retina display covered in scratch-resistant sapphire crystal 2.    Apple Watch Sport = anodized aluminum enclosure w/ retina display made lightweight and scratch-resistant by using aluminosilicate glass (Ion-X glass) 3.    Apple Watch Edition = 18-karat gold w/ retina display covered in scratch-resistant sapphire crystal Each watch will come in two sizes â€“ 38 mm and 42 mm â€“ and we believe Apple recognizes a watch communicates a userâ€™s self-expression as much as it provides utility, so Watches offer some personalization (e.g., in contrast to Appleâ€™s typical product strategy of tightly-limited SKUs), available in multiple colors and models, using multiple detachable band options. Watches offer various changeable faces. Pricing starts from $349, which we presume is for the aluminum Sport model, while we currently now model a blended ASP of $500, since we estimate mainstream models likely priced >$500 and high-end 18k gold models (even if niche) likely priced in the thousands. 2 143 January 5, 2015 Figure 2.

For example, we might not be super excited if it was a Dell Watch, but Apple has proved a leader in design, style and branding. rd A 3 hurdle may be battery life (e.g., Apple Watch likely to require nightly charging) and even Apple cannot bypass the laws of chemistry, but it has attempted to design for as little battery drain as possible, offloading the heavy-lifting of all code execution to the paired iPhone, while using relatively clever snap-on inductive charging to at least make the process as seamless as possible. We see battery life as the primary reason Apple Watch is an iPhone accessory vs. standalone product. Figure 3.
